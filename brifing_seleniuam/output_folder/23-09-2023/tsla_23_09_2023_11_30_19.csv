"20-Jul-23  10:14 ET","TSLA","Tesla fails to steer around margin concerns in Q2, sending shares in reverse
  (273.55 
-17.71
)
Record vehicle deliveries and moderating raw materials prices helped 
Tesla
 (
TSLA
) drive past 2Q23 EPS and revenue expectations, but the EV makers' declining margins, aggressive investment plans, and warning that more price cuts may be on the way have the stock in reverse today.
With shares skyrocketing by about 140% this year, resulting in a steep 1-year forward P/E of around 60x, 
TSLA
 had little room for error. While there are plenty of positives, including a reaffirm of FY23 production of 1.8 mln vehicles, the blemishes are significant enough to elicit a profit-taking pullback.
Heading into the report, a popular narrative was that 
TSLA
's margins were set to stabilize in Q2, setting the stage for meaningful improvements in 2H23. Now, however, that presumption looks premature after 
TSLA
's automotive gross margin slipped to about 18%, while GAAP gross margin dove by 682 bps yr/yr to 18.2%, missing expectations. 
The bigger issue, though, is that Elon Musk signaled that more margin-eroding price cuts could soon be on the way as the EV price war rages on. Compared to a year ago, the average selling price has already fallen by nearly 20%.
After digesting that news, earnings call participants were greeted by Musk's proclamation that 
TSLA
 will spend more than $1.0 bln by the end of 2024 to develop a supercomputer called ""Dojo."" That disclosure isn't sitting too well with investors who are becoming increasingly anxious about 
TSLA
's profitability. 
In typical Musk fashion, the eccentric CEO promised that the investments in Dojo, which is accumulating massive amounts of video data from 
TSLA
 vehicles, will ultimately make the company's current financial metrics ""look silly."" Dojo will be used to power 
TSLA
's full self-driving (FSD) technology and is viewed by Musk as the key to substantially increasing the value of current and future vehicles.
Musk is comfortable with the idea of sacrificing margins for volume since more cars on the road now equates to greater FSD-related revenue down the road. Of course, Musk has over-promised and under-delivered on the development of FSD, so investors are taking his statements with a grain of salt. 
On that note, during the earnings call, he said that he thinks FSD will be better than human driving capability by the end of this year.
Speaking of ""looking silly"", the Cybertruck was another main topic last night, with Musk seemingly walking back the expectation that deliveries will begin in Q1. Instead, he simply stated that the first deliveries are slated for later this year and that production will gradually increase in 2024.
Overall, it's a mixed bag for 
TSLA
 with sales remaining very healthy, but at the expense of margins. Participants wanted to come away from this report with the feeling that margins have bottomed out and are set to improve in 2H, but that didn't happen, resulting in a profit-taking sell-off.

"20-Jul-23  06:01 ET","TSLA","Tesla: Key comments from conference call last night
  (291.26)
The company achieved record vehicle production and deliveries.

The company continues to target 1.8mm vehicle deliveries this year, although it expects that Q3 production will be a little bit down because of summer shutdowns for a lot of factory upgrades.
The short-term variances in gross margin and profitability really are minor relative to the long-term picture.
When interest rates rise, the company said it has to reduce the price of the car because the interest payments increase the price of the car.
CyberTruck has a lot of new technology in it.

  (294.37

)
After the close, 
Tesla 
(
TSLA
) is scheduled to report 2Q23 earnings with a conference call set to follow at 5:30 p.m. ET. The electric vehicle maker's earnings report is expected to be posted on the Investor Relations page of its website at about 4:05 p.m., followed soon thereafter by a press release.
The current FactSet consensus estimate stands at EPS of $0.80 and $24.2 bln, reflecting an estimated yr/yr EPS decline of 65% on a 43% increase in revenue.
On July 3, 
TSLA
 reported record Q2 deliveries of 466,140 (+83% yr/yr), exceeding expectations while illustrating that its aggressive price-cutting strategy has amped up demand
. 
Similar to last quarter, 
TSLA
's automotive gross margin (excluding regulatory credits) will be under the spotlight as participants assess the impact of the company's price cuts.
 In Q1, automotive gross margin cratered by five percentage points sequentially to about 16%, while 
TSLA
's overall gross margin of 19% fell well short of estimates.
The general expectation among analysts is that margins will bottom out this quarter before improving in 2H23. With production and volumes ramping up at the Austin, TX and Berlin, Germany factories, manufacturing efficiencies should be improving, providing a boost to automotive gross margins.
The big news this week was that 
TSLA
 built its first Cybertruck at the Austin, TX factory
. During the Q1 earnings call in April, Elon Musk commented that there's a ""tremendous amount of demand"" for Cybertruck, which represents 
TSLA
's first new vehicle launch since it introduced the Model Y SUV in 2020. However, Cybertruck won't move the needle much this year in terms of deliveries and revenue as 
TSLA
 gradually ramps up production. Next year, though, Cybertruck is poised to become a significant growth catalyst.
TSLA
's production guidance, which should be provided in the shareholder deck, will also be closely monitored. Last quarter, the company reaffirmed its expectation to deliver about 1.8 mln vehicles in FY23
, representing impressive yr/yr growth of 31%. Elon Musk upped the ante during the earnings call, though, stating that the company may be able to reach the 2.0 mln mark this year for deliveries.
The stock is red-hot heading into the report, soaring by about 140% on a year-to-date basis. In turn, the stock's valuation has reached sky-high levels with a 1-year forward P/E of around 60x.
 The impressive rally and rich valuation raises the risk of a sell-the-news reaction, but it's also worth keeping in mind that 
TSLA
 hasn't missed EPS expectations since 2Q19. (PVIEW)

  (280.63 
+18.86
)
Ongoing price cuts and U.S. tax credits for electric vehicles (EVs) again offset the broader economic headwinds in Q2, including higher interest rates and sticky inflation, fueling 
Tesla's (
TSLA
 +7%)
 record deliveries in the quarter and energizing the stock. Tesla delivered 466,140 vehicles in Q2, nicely ahead of street estimates and a 10.5% improvement from the previous quarter, which was also a record. 
 Tesla's delivery report may also not be the sole factor sending its shares higher today. Several other EV manufacturers, including 
Rivian (RIVN)
, 
XPeng (XPEV)
, 
NIO (NIO)
, and 
Li Auto (LI)
, each registered solid delivery figures in Q2 and June, a broader reflection of underlying health within the EV industry. The upbeat reports are also lifting other non-pure EV OEMs, such as 
Ford (F)
, 
General Motors (GM)
, and 
Volkswagen (VWAGY)
. 
Tesla divides its deliveries into Model S/X (higher-priced models) and Model 3/Y (lower-priced models). Its lower-priced Model 3/Y group exhibited notable strength, with deliveries up a whopping 87.4% yr/yr and 8.4% sequentially to 446,915. The yr/yr growth showcased the pent-up demand following a lengthy chip shortage that hindered production last year. 
 Meanwhile, Model S/X deliveries were the inverse, climbing 19.0% yr/yr and 79.8% sequentially to 19,225. The massive leap from Q1 is due to January price cuts, which were most significant across the Model S and X lineup, not taking effect until March. Additional reductions in April also saw Tesla's higher-tier lineup receive larger discounts than the Model 3 and Y. 
However, even though the slashed prices helped power higher deliveries, it likely came at the further expense of margins. Last quarter, this worry partly contributed to a notable sell-off. Tesla also did see margin erosion during Q1, with total gross margins contracting by 977 bps yr/yr and 450 bps sequentially to 19.3%, well shy of analyst expectations. 
 Furthermore, a disparity between production (479,700) and deliveries (466,140) remained relatively wide in Q2. When production continues to exceed deliveries, it signals rising inventories, a reflection of potential demand weakness. However, the discrepancy continued to narrow over the past three quarters on an absolute and percentage basis. Additionally, management remarked last quarter that the production/delivery difference resulted from the company moving to a more-regional balanced mix of build and deliveries.
  Tesla's recent price cuts to qualify its vehicle lineup for the new U.S. tax credits have sparked a significant rally in deliveries over the past two quarters. Unlike after its Q1 report, investors applaud Tesla's numbers from Q2, a reflection of dissipating worries that China-based competitors are stealing market share and macroeconomic conditions are eroding demand. 
 Although margins will likely undergo another quarter of contraction in Q2 (scheduled for July 19), Tesla's actions have spurred considerable demand. They may also accelerate its long-term goal of reaching 20 mln in annual deliveries. With Tesla's charging technology quickly becoming the U.S. standard following deals with Ford and GM and its long-awaited Cybertruck slated for launch this year, the company is showing no signs of letting off the throttle despite its shares already surging over 140% YTD.

  (252.09 
+17.23
)
The good news keeps pouring in for 
Tesla
 (
TSLA
), which is trading at its highest levels since early October of last year, with the stock receiving yet another boost  courtesy of 
General Motors
 (
GM
). About two weeks after rival 
Ford Motor
 (
F
) reached an agreement with 
TSLA
 that provides its EV customers with access to Tesla Superchargers, GM announced a similar deal with 
TSLA
 last night. Specifically, the partnership will allow GM's EV drivers to use 12,000 Tesla Superchargers across North America starting in 2024 in a move that market participants are viewing as a win-win situation.
For 
TSLA
, the benefit of these agreements with GM and Ford is two-fold.
First, and most importantly, providing GM and Ford access to its Superchargers will likely give it an insurmountable lead in the race to establish an industry standard for charging. Currently, there are two primary charging systems in the market: the North American Charging Standard (NACS) design that 
TSLA
 has adopted, and the Combined Charging System (CCS) used by GM, Ford, and other EV makers.
Initially, GM customers will need to use an adapter to access 
TSLA
's Supercharger stations, but beginning in 2025, the company's EVs will be built with a NACS inlet, removing the need for an adapter. 
With GM and Ford switching over to the NACS connector design, 
TSLA
's charging network will significantly expand while likely ultimately becoming the single standard. A more robust charging network across the country will make 
TSLA
's vehicles even more marketable, reducing customers' concerns about inadequate charging options on the roadways.
Second, 
TSLA
 will generate substantially more revenue from its Supercharger stations. In 3Q23, Services and Other Revenue, which includes paid Supercharging fees, increased by 44% to $1.8 bln. 
Although the Services and Other category only represented about 8% of 
TSLA
's total revenue in Q3, that percentage should increase as GM and Ford EV customers begin accessing its charging stations. 
For some context, GM has said that it will have the capacity to build 1.0 mln EVs in North America by 2025, while Ford is targeting a 2.0 mln EV run rate by 2026.
From GM's perspective, the upside of partnering with 
TSLA
 is that it will instantly and significantly expand the charging network for its customers, without having to invest in the buildout of its own system. CEO Mary Barra commented that collaborating with 
TSLA
 ""knocks down a possible barrier to car buyers, some of whom worry about adequate charging"" on the roads.
The main takeaway is that this agreement with GM is another big win for 
TSLA
, amplifying a bullish sentiment that has defined the stock over the past month. Earlier this week, it was reported that all trims of the company's Model 3 sedan now officially qualify for the full $7,500 tax credit, following a report from 
Electrek
 on May 25 that 
TSLA
's Model Y became the world's best-selling car. Looking further down the road, the upcoming launch of the Cybertruck later this summer could represent the next catalyst for 
TSLA

"20-Apr-23  10:26 ET","TSLA","Tesla's aggressive price cutting strategy puts major dent in margins, sending stock in reverse
  (167.02 
-13.57
)
The million-dollar question heading into 
Tesla's
 (
TSLA
) 1Q23 earnings report was whether the electric vehicle maker's margins would at least meet expectations following a series of price cuts in the U.S. and China.
Last night, investors didn't receive the answer they were looking for as automotive gross margin (excluding regulatory credits) cratered by five percentage points sequentially to about 16%, while 
TSLA
's overall gross margin of 19% fell well short of estimates. 
Some may recall that CFO Zachary Kirkhorn stated that FY23 automotive gross margin should stay above 20% for FY23, but a steep drop in ASPs this quarter pushed the metric below that floor level.
Despite the plunge in gross margin, 
TSLA
 still managed to meet EPS estimates. 
However, 
TSLA
's profitability and cash flow on a yr/yr basis is heading in reverse. Specifically, net income and free cash flow tumbled by 22% and 80%, respectively. Making matters worse for the stock, CEO Elon Musk signaled during the earnings call that more price cuts could be on the horizon, stating that he intends to continue leveraging the company's position as a cost leader.
Essentially, Musk is creating a price war in the EV market -- whether he wants to admit it or not -- in order to protect/gain market share and grow volumes, at the expense of profits. This isn't a positive development for other EV makers, especially for up-and-coming companies like 
Rivian 
(
RIVN
) or 
Lucid Group
 (
LCID
) that are already being squeezed by manufacturing inefficiencies due to low production volumes.
It's also not a positive for 
TSLA
 -- at least, not in the short-term. The stock is not cheap, trading with a Forward P/E of nearly 50x. With the ""E"" component of that valuation metric set to decline, the ""P"" component will have to follow suit in order to avoid a valuation that truly reaches nose-bleed levels.
On the positive side, 
TSLA
 did reaffirm its expectation to deliver about 1.8 mln vehicles in FY23, representing impressive yr/yr growth of 31%. 
In fact, just like last quarter, Musk said that the company may be able to reach the 2 mln mark this year for deliveries. Even as Musk predicts more ""stormy weather"" for the economy this year, he expects that demand will hold up quite well.
Additionally, Mr. Kirkhorn noted that cost reductions and improved efficiency at its new factories should support improved margins later this year. Whether those factors are enough to fully offset the price cuts and drive automotive gross margin back above 20% remains to be seen, but at least the trend for improved production efficiency is accelerating.
The main takeaway is that 
TSLA
's aggressive price cutting strategy is having a worse-than-feared impact on its margins and profits, which is a bad recipe for an expensive stock. From a longer-term perspective, the company's strategy to drive volume higher and extend its lead in the EV market will probably pay dividends, but it's going to be bumpy ride for investors as its profits dwindle.

The company reduced prices considerably in early Q1, but its operating margin remains among the best in the industry. The company is under the view that pushing for higher volumes and a larger fleet is the right choice here versus a lower volume and higher margin. The company expects its vehicles, over time, will be able to generate significant profit through autonomy.
Regarding the Cybertruck, the company continues to build Alpha versions of the Cybertruck and the company is anticipating having delivery event in Q3.

  (181.46

After the close, leading electric vehicle maker 
Tesla 
(
TSLA
) is scheduled to report 1Q23 earnings with a conference call set to follow at 5:30 p.m. E.T. The company's earnings report is expected to be posted on the Investor Relations page of its website at about 4:05 p.m., followed soon thereafter by a press release.
For the quarter, 
TSLA
 is expected to post EPS and revenue of $0.85 and $23.36 bln, respectively. On a yr/yr basis, an inline quarter would equate to a yr/yr EPS decline of 74%, on a revenue increase of 24.5%.
The main story revolving around 
TSLA
 over the past several months has been its steady stream of price cuts and the anticipated impact on automotive gross margin from those price cuts. Just last night, the company once again lowered its prices, this time reducing the price on each version of its Model Y SUV by $3,000 and cutting the cost on the base Model 3 by nearly 5%.
This round of cuts marks the sixth time that 
TSLA
 has reduced prices over the past year. Recall that in January, the company slashed U.S. prices by as much as 20% on the Model Y and Model 3 vehicles in order to qualify those vehicles for tax credits under the Inflation Reduction Act.
Prior to the U.S. price cuts, 
TSLA
 looked to spark demand in China by lowering prices for all versions of its Model 3 and Model Y cars in October, and then again in January.
From a demand perspective, the pricing strategy has been a clear success. When 
TSLA
 reported Q4 earnings in late January, CEO Elon Musk stated that January had so far seen the strongest orders on a year-to-date basis in the company's history, and that orders are coming in at almost twice the rate of production.
Fast forward to April 3, and 
TSLA
 reported a new quarterly record for deliveries, which increased by 36% yr/yr to 422,875, slightly topping analysts' estimates. Model 3 and Model Y were especially strong with combined deliveries of 412,180, up 40% yr/yr, illustrating the positive impact from the price cuts.
The big question heading into this earnings report, though, is how severe of an impact those price cuts have had on 
TSLA
's automotive gross margin
. Last quarter, automotive gross margin dipped by 466 bps yr/yr to 25.9% -- even as ASPs were up on a yr/yr basis -- as the launch of new plants in Austin, TX and Berlin, Germany weighed on margins. Most of the price cuts didn't take hold until Q1, so the yr/yr decline in automotive gross margin could be pretty jarring tonight.
CFO Zachary Kirkhorn has stated that FY23 automotive gross margin should remain above 20% with average selling prices in the high $40K range.
 Therefore, if automotive gross margin comes in comfortably ahead of that 20% mark, that could be a positive catalyst for the stock.
TSLA
's annual production guidance will be another closely monitored item. In the Q4 earnings report, the company guided for production of 1.8 mln vehicles this year, equating to yr/yr growth of about 37%.
 However, Musk revealed that internal projections are targeting production closer to 2.0 mln vehicles and that he wanted to remain conservative with the published guidance due to uncertainties regarding the supply chain and economy. Should 
TSLA
 produce 2.0 mln vehicles this year, that would equate to yr/yr growth of 46%.
Finally, 
TSLA
's recent history of outperforming analysts' expectations is encouraging. On that note, the company has exceeded EPS and revenue estimates in seven of the past eight quarters,
