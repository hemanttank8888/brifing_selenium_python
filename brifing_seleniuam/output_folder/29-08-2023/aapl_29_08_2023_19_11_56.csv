  (185.40 
-5.77
)
The unfavorable macroeconomic climate took a bite out of 
Apple (
AAPL
 -2%) 
in Q3 (Jun). The iPhone maker did register decent earnings upside and in-line revs in the quarter. However, iPhone sales came up short of analyst expectations. Other products, including iPad and wearables, also took a hit as challenging yr/yr comparisons and FX headwinds added further obstacles. Discouragingly, Apple expects similar sales performance to the 1.4% decline from JunQ in Q4 (Sep), below what analysts forecasted. 
 iPhone revenue slipped by 2% yr/yr in JunQ to $39.7 bln. However, on a constant currency basis, iPhone saw positive growth in the quarter, setting JunQ records in several emerging markets, such as India, which Apple has noted is at a tipping point, and Mexico. iPhone also overcame a difficult demand environment in parts of Europe, setting records across France, the Netherlands, and Austria. 
Unlike last quarter, Mac revenue of $6.8 bln, a 7% dip, topped estimates in JunQ. Apple's transition to running its entire Mac lineup on its in-house silicon likely helped boost Mac sales, given the enormous jump in processing power over previous 
Intel (INTC)
 chips.
Conversely, iPad sales continued to underperform, tumbling 20% yr/yr to $5.8 bln. The lackluster growth stemmed partly from an unfavorable yr/yr comparison when Apple launched the revamped iPad Air. Although iPad comprises the smallest chunk of total revenue, it tends to be the device that attracts first-time customers into the Apple ecosystem, given the poor selection of competing tablets and frustrating Android 
(GOOG) 
support. With iPad more discretionary than a phone or computer, the demand backdrop could hinder new customer growth over the near term. 
However, wearables, including the Apple Watch, which, albeit missed sales estimates,  could fill this void. CFO Luca Maestri mentioned that roughly two-thirds of customers purchasing an Apple Watch were new to the product. When considering one of the best smartwatches to own, the Apple Watch typically tops the leaderboards. Since the best experience on an Apple Watch requires an iPhone, a potential Apple Watch buyer must also consider purchasing an iPhone. 
While product revenue was down 4% yr/yr, Services revenue growth accelerated to +8%, up from the +5% posted in MarQ, reflecting the strength of Apple's ecosystem. As Apple bolsters its global presence, more users are exposed to the numerous services offered through Apple products, including Apple Arcade, Apple TV, and Apple Card, which is required to set up a high-yield savings account that has seen over $10 bln in deposits since its Spring launch. 
Apple's JunQ report was mostly upbeat, containing several highlights from emerging market strength to accelerating Services growth. However, alongside weak iPhone sales, SepQ guidance translates to a possible fourth-straight quarter of declining revenue, a concerning development. Prominent suppliers 
Taiwan Semi (TSM)
 and 
Qualcomm (QCOM)
 have also warned about lingering global demand weakness for the remainder of the year, setting up for a potentially challenging 1Q24 (Dec) for Apple as well. Still, over the longer term, Apple is cementing itself as a leader in consumer tech, with the capacity to expand sales considerably with the upcoming launch of Apple Vision Pro early next year.

Apple (
AAPL
 +5%) 
is trading nicely higher after reporting Q2 (Mar) results last night. The headline numbers of a nice EPS beat and upside revenue were quite good, especially in light of macro and FX headwinds. After production headaches due to China COVID shutdowns in DecQ, Apple says that supply was not a problem in MarQ. Apple also announced a $90 bln share repurchase program and hiked the dividend by 4%. 
iPhone was the star of the show
 with revenue coming in much better than expected. Revenue rose 1.5% yr/yr to $51.33 bln, a record iPhone result for MarQ. Apple says iPhone 14 continues to delight users with its long-lasting battery and advanced camera. Apple said that production issues in DecQ may have pushed some sales into MarQ. iPhone outperformance helped to offset weakness in other areas. 
 
Probably the biggest disappointment was Mac sales
, which fell 31% yr/yr to $7.17 bln, which was below street estimates. In fairness, Mac was lapping a very difficult compare last year which included the incredibly successful rollout of its M1 chips throughout its Mac lineup. However, Apple also conceded that Mac faced some macroeconomic and FX headwinds. 
iPad revenue fell 13%
 yr/yr at $6.67 bln, which was in-line with street ests, Similar to Mac, iPad revenue was hurt by macro and FX challenges as well as lapping the M1-powered iPad Air last year. 
 
Wearables revenue was flat
 yr/yr at $8.76 bln, which was slight upside. Wearables was up 5% to $20.9 bln, which was a bit light but not bad. 
 
Emerging Markets was another important topic
 with India being described as an ""incredibly exciting market"" and a major focus for Apple. It just launched its first two Apple stores there, one in Mumbai and one in Delhi. CEO Tim Cook visited and saw a lot of excitement firsthand. There are a lot of people coming into the middle-class, and Apple feels that India is at a tipping point. Apple also had a stellar quarter in other emerging markets, with records set in several countries. 
Overall, it was a solid quarter but pretty much as expected. 
Strong iPhone revenue helped to offset some weakness in Macs an iPads. The sizeable buyback authorization and dividend hike were a nice bonus. 
All eyes now turn to WWDC
, Apple's annual Worldwide Developers Conference in early June. Excitement is building for what is expected to be the launch of Apple's AR/VR headset, which would be a new product category for Apple. The first headsets are expected to be pretty pricey with cheaper versions likely in the next couple of years.

Apple today announced a major expansion of its Restore Fund, doubling the company's total commitment to advancing high-quality, nature-based carbon removal projects. First launched in 2021 with an up to $200 million commitment with Conservation International and Goldman Sachs, the Restore Fund is now set to grow with an additional fund, including new investment from Apple, and a new portfolio of carbon removal projects. Apple created the Restore Fund to encourage global investment to protect and restore critical ecosystems and scale natural carbon removal solutions. This approach also helps address residual emissions businesses cannot yet avoid or reduce with existing technology. 
As part of the expansion, Apple will invest up to an additional $200 million in the new fund, which Climate Asset Management — a joint venture of HSBC Asset Management (
HSBC 
unit) and Pollination — will manage. The new portfolio also aims to remove 1 million metric tons of carbon dioxide per year at its peak while generating a financial return for investors. For Apple suppliers that become partners in the fund, it will also offer a new way for them to incorporate high-impact carbon removal projects as they decarbonize.

  (147.92)
Today's Statement of Objections clarifies that the Commission does no longer take a position as to the legality of the IAP obligation for the purposes of this antitrust investigation but rather focuses on the contractual restrictions that Apple imposed on app developers which prevent them from informing iPhone and iPad users of alternative music subscription options at lower prices outside of the app and to effectively choose those.
The Commission takes the preliminary view that Apple's anti-steering obligations are unfair trading conditions in breach of Article 102 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.
In particular, the Commission is concerned that the anti-steering obligations imposed by Apple on music streaming app developers prevent those developers from informing consumers about where and how to subscribe to streaming services at lower prices.  These anti-steering obligations: (i) are neither necessary nor proportionate for the provision of the App Store on iPhones and iPads; (ii) are detrimental to users of music streaming services on Apple's mobile devices who may end up paying more; and (iii) negatively affect the interests of music streaming app developers by limiting effective consumer choice.

"03-Feb-23  09:53 ET","AAPL","Apple recoups earlier losses as investors keep the spotlight on the many bright spots in DecQ
  (151.87 
+1.05
)
Apple (
AAPL
)
 is amid a strong comeback today despite registering top- and bottom-line misses in Q1 (Dec) due to a continually unfavorable macroeconomic environment. Also, the tech giant forecasted Q2 (Mar) sales performance to mirror Q1, translating to another rare yr/yr decline and below analyst projections.
  In addition to weakening consumer sentiment, 
AAPL
 faced other challenges outside its control in Q1, including a relatively strong U.S. dollar and supply chain constraints. These headwinds resulted in adjusted earnings slipping by 10.5% yr/yr to $1.88 and revs sinking by 5.5% to $117.15 bln, 
AAPL
's first quarterly decline since 2Q19 (Mar). Additionally, the revenue from iPhones, Macs, and wearables missed analyst estimates in the quarter. 
 However, despite the tepid headline results and climbing over 20% to start the year, shares are holding up nicely today, recouping their initial losses. 
 A significant factor buoying the stock was that 
AAPL
 has more of a supply problem than a demand one, similar to last quarter. iPhone supply could not keep pace with demand in Q1, causing ship times to extend well beyond what 
AAPL
 anticipated. 
 Also, although iPhone supply was constrained during the quarter, 
AAPL
 managed to keep sales from dipping, maintaining relatively flat iPhone revs yr/yr at $65.8 bln. Meanwhile, iPad revenue jumped by over 13% yr/yr to $9.4 bln, crushing the consensus, which called for a single-digit decline. 
On the flip side, 
AAPL
 does not expect iPad to continue seeing growth, forecasting a double-digit decline yr/yr in MarQ. 
AAPL
 provided the same outlook for Mac sales. 
 It was also encouraging to hear CEO Tim Cook comment that production is now back to where it should be, especially after several disruptions in China throughout the past few months sparked heightened uncertainty. As a result, 
AAPL
 projects iPhone revs to accelerate sequentially in MarQ. 
Furthermore, if not for foreign exchange impacts, which clipped 800 bps off sales growth in the quarter, 
AAPL
 would have seen positive growth yr/yr and posted growth in most of the markets it tracks. The same story will also play out in MarQ, as 
AAPL
 projects FX headwinds to dent sales growth by 5 pts. 
AAPL
 also reached a milestone in the quarter, boasting over two billion active devices as part of its installed base, double the figure from seven years ago. The significance of this achievement is that it represents a sturdy foundation for future ecosystem expansion. 
AAPL
 tempered expectations heading into Q1, expecting revs to decelerate sequentially and Mac revs to experience a substantial decline due to challenging comps. As a result, although its Q1 report was not exactly crisp, 
AAPL
 delivered relatively decent numbers, especially when stacked against the numerous obstacles it had to endure. It is crystal clear by now that 2023 will be a turbulent year for tech firms with heavy consumer exposure. However, it is hard to bet against 
AAPL
 and its exceptional brand loyalty, especially when the company continues to demonstrate that demand remains sound.

  (148.53 
+3.10
)
Apple (
AAPL
) will report Q1 (Dec) earnings tonight after the close.  There is a conference call scheduled for 17:00 ET. 
Q1 Capital IQ consensus calls for EPS of $1.95 (versus $2.10 last year) on revenue of $121.65 bln (versus -2% yr/yr). The Street is expecting Q1 gross margins of 43.0% versus 43.8% last year. 
This is the first full quarter where the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Pro will be included in its earnings.  On the last conference call, the company expected that revenue growth will decelerate in Q1 (Dec) vs Q4 (Sep).  Mac revenue is expected to decline substantially due to tough comparable from last year. Gross margins are expected to be 42.5-43.5%. There were press reports suggesting that Apple is lowering production of iPhone 14 Plus. It will be interesting to know if this issue extends towards the more expensive Pro models. In addition, any color around the potential timing of new AR/VR headset release will be of interest. 
Investors should not expect a stock buyback announcement similar to what Meta (META) did.  Apple always updates its capital return program in Q2 (Mar).
The company has not provided exact revenue guidance since the pandemic began
. It will be interesting when and if the company starts providing exact guidance again. 
Q2 Capital IQ consensus calls for EPS of $1.47 (versus $1.52 last year) on revenue of $97.03 bln (roughly unchanged yr/yr). The Street is expecting Q2 gross margins of 43.1% versus 43.8% last year.
The Street is expecting Q1 iPhone revenue of $69.0 bln vs. $65.6 bln last year,
 Mac revenue of $9.8 bln vs. $8.7 bln last year, iPad revenue of $7.6 bln vs. $8.3 bln last year, wearables revenue of $15.1 bln vs. $13.0 bln last year, and services revenue of $20.8 bln vs. $15.8 bln last year.
When the company reported Q4 (Sep), CEO Tim Cook quelled fears of waning demand by citing supply issues as the culprit. Still, 
AAPL
 is not immune to the macroeconomic obstacles weakening demand. CFO Luca Maestri pointed out that digital advertising and gaming are areas where the company is experiencing softness. iPhone revs of $42.6 bln, a 10% climb yr/yr, was also a Q4 record. A notable development was exceptional growth in emerging markets, such as India, Vietnam, and Indonesia, which each doubled iPhone sales yr/yr. Although 
AAPL
 has been seeing tremendous growth in emerging markets for some time, we like seeing this continue, especially during an economic downturn, as it highlights the company's ability to translate its marketing prowess and brand power to many different customers and cultures.
AAPL
 has a $2.27 trillion valuation and currently trades at 23 times FY23 earnings.
Based on the weekly

Hence, Foxconn as the sole assembler of the new Pro models has been under significant strain. Besides the Zhengzhou base, Foxconn is also drawing support from its other major base located in the Chinese city of Shenzhen. However, this move still not enough to bring an immediate relief to the current capacity crunch. Given this situation, TrendForce has corrected down its projection on the total shipments of all iPhone 14 models in 2022 to 78.1 million units.""

Apple (
AAPL
 -1%)
 is hitting a snag today after reports suggested iPhone production may dive by around 30% in November due to China's COVID policies. 
The issue stems from the Foxconn factory in China, where well over half of all iPhones are manufactured. If reports are correct, an already supply-constrained backdrop for 
AAPL
 would only intensify. 
Last week, 
AAPL
 initially saw its shares turn lower as investors digested iPhone sales missing analyst estimates, only to climb back and finish the day well in the green after CEO Tim Cook commented that supply was the primary issue as opposed to demand. 
Although supply constraints are a better situation than softening demand, 
AAPL
 could report its second-straight iPhone sales miss in Q1 (Dec) if it cannot keep pace with demand. 
 Lastly, 
AAPL
's China-related woes do not paint a pretty picture for many of its silicon suppliers, including 
SWKS
, 
CRUS
, 
AVGO
,

"28-Oct-22  09:42 ET","AAPL","Apple looks crisp today as investors quickly look past supply issues causing a miss on iPhone sales in Q4
  (151.17 
6.37
)
Apple (
AAPL
 +4%)
 is looking crisp today, recovering from a sell-the-news reaction after the company reported lower-than-expected iPhone sales in Q4 (Sep). CEO Tim Cook quelled fears of waning demand by citing supply issues as the culprit. 
 Still, 
AAPL
 is not immune to the macroeconomic obstacles weakening demand. CFO Luca Maestri pointed out that digital advertising and gaming are areas where the company is experiencing softness, reiterating comments made by 
Snap (SNAP)
, which is seeing the digital advertising market slow, and 
Take-Two (TTWO)
, whose mobile gaming division is facing softness. These headwinds will mainly negatively affect 
AAPL
's Services segment, which it still expects to grow yr/yr in Q1 (Dec), but be impacted by the current economic situation and foreign currency fluctuations. 
 Speaking of which, FX impacts clipped over 600 bps off 
AAPL
's revenue growth in Q4. Still, the figure climbed 7.8% yr/yr to $90.15 bln, well ahead of consensus. 
 Earnings also jumped ahead of analyst expectations in the quarter, gaining 4.0% yr/yr to $1.29 per share. Gross margins setting a Q4 record at 42.3%, which also met 
AAPL
's prior expectations of 41.5-42.5%, helped the company expand its earnings despite the FX impact drag. 
 iPhone revs of $42.6 bln, a 10% climb yr/yr, was also a Q4 record. A notable development was exceptional growth in emerging markets, such as India, Vietnam, and Indonesia, which each doubled iPhone sales yr/yr. Although 
AAPL
 has been seeing tremendous growth in emerging markets for some time, we like seeing this continue, especially during an economic downturn, as it highlights the company's ability to translate its marketing prowess and brand power to many different customers and cultures. 
Another positive stand out was Mac achieving record revs of $11.5 bln, a 25% increase yr/yr, more than enough to topple estimates. However, much of the improvement yr/yr stemmed from 
AAPL
's supply catching up with demand, satisfying pent-up demand that carried forward from Q3 (Jun). Still, given the steep drop-offs in PC demand lately, it was encouraging to see that consumers still wanted to purchase Macs they could not get during JunQ.
  The laggard in Q4 was iPad, where revs tumbled 13% yr/yr to $7.2 bln due to FX impacts and an unfavorable comparison from the year-ago period. 
Looking ahead to Q1, 
AAPL
 still did not provide detailed estimates, noting that it expects revenue growth to decelerate compared to Q4. A significant component of this is FX impacts, which is expected to take nearly 10 pts off growth. Also, a challenging comparison from the year-ago period is setting up Mac sales to substantially decline yr/yr, which will further weigh on overall growth. Gross margins are expected to expand slightly, with 
AAPL
 projecting 42.5-43.5%. 
Bottom line, 
AAPL
's Q4 results highlight the impressive brand loyalty the company has garnered, allowing it to continue delivering solid growth during an environment that has taken a toll on many of its peers. Although Q1 is not shaping up to be an exciting quarter, the situation could have been much worse. Plus, with demand remaining relatively healthy, investors are not overly concerned with the factors weighing on 
AAPL
's near-term results as they are largely outside its control.

The company has not provided exact revenue guidance since the pandemic began
. It will be interesting when and if the company starts providing exact guidance again. Q1 Capital IQ consensus (holiday quarter) calls for revenues of $128.3 bln, up 0.3%. The Street is expecting Q1 gross margins of 42.8% versus 43.8% last year. On the last conference call, the company did not provide exact revenue guidance. However, it expects Q4 supply constraints to be lower than Q3. It expects Q4 services revenue growth to slow from Q3. The company sees Q4 gross margin of 41.5-42.5%.

  (161.20

)
Apple (
AAPL
 +2%)
 is trading nicely higher after reporting Q3 (Jun) results last night. 
 
The headline numbers of a nice EPS beat and in-line revs were quite good,
 especially in light of FX headwinds. Also, last quarter Apple prepared investors to brace for ugly supply chain constraints in JunQ. As it turns out, the constraints were not as bad as expected, which was a big relief for investors. 
iPhone was the star of the show 
with revenue coming in much better than expected. Analysts had been expecting a slight yr/yr sales decline, but revenue grew 3% yr/yr to $40.67 bln. Apple set a JunQ record for both revenue and switchers to iPhone. Customers see iPhone as the gold standard for smartphones and they have been raving about the iPhone 13's camera quality with features like cinematic mode and macro photography. 
iPad also came in better than expected.
 However, Mac, Wearables and Services were a bit light (see 16:39 InPlay for specific comparisons). Apple cited supply constraints and FX headwinds for these categories not performing quite as well as expected. 
Looking ahead to SepQ, Apple chose not to provide revenue guidance, which was a bit of a letdown. However, it did say it expects yr/yr revenue growth will accelerate during SepQ relative to JunQ. More importantly, it expects supply constraints to be lower in SepQ than what it experienced during JunQ. However, gross margin guidance of 41.5-42.5% is a bit below the 43.2% achieved in JunQ. 
The key takeaway from this report
 is that the JunQ supply chain constraints turned out to be less of an issue than the pessimistic view Apple presented on its last call. And SepQ should be even better than JunQ. This is a huge relief for investors as Apple's commentary on the last call was about as bearish we have ever heard them on supply chain issues. The other standout in this report was robust iPhone sales, and that is despite the fact that Apple is likely to launch iPhone 14 in just a few months. Overall, Apple does what it does. It handled a tough supply situation quite well and reminded investors why it is such a great company that cannot be held down for long.

  (155.38 
-1.43
)
Apple (
AAPL
) will report third quarter earnings (Jun)
tonight after the close. There is a conference call scheduled for 17:00 ET. 
Q3
Capital IQ consensus calls for EPS of $1.15 (versus $1.30 last year) on revenue
of $82.97 billion (versus +2% yr/yr).
 The Street is expecting Q3 gross margins
of 43.0% versus 43.3% last year (guidance 42-43%).
The company has not provided
exact revenue guidance since the pandemic began. It will be interesting when
and if the company starts providing exact guidance again. Capital IQ consensus
calls for Q4 revenues of $90.08 billion (+7.6% yr/yr).  The Street is expecting Q4 gross margins of
42.5% versus 42.2% last year.
On the last conference call, the company said that June quarter revenue
performance will be impacted by COVID-19 supply issues and semiconductor
shortages.  It expects Q3 (Jun) impact
from supply chain issues to be $4-8 bln, which is ""substantially
larger"" than what it experienced during the March quarter. The company
expects services to grow double digits, but growth will slow from March quarter.
The Street is expecting Q3 iPhones of $38.3 bln versus $39.6 bln last year, 
Q3
iPads of $6.9 bln versus $7.4 bln last year, Q3 Macs of $8.8 bln versus $8.2
bln last year, Wearables and other products of $9.0 bln versus $8.8 bln last
year, and services of $19.9 bln versus $17.5 bln last year. 
AAPL
 beat on EPS and revenues three out of the last four quarters. In Q2, iPhone,
iPad, Mac, and Services all performed better than analyst expectations despite
supply constraints.
AAPL
 has a $2.46 trillion valuation and currently trades at 24 times FY22
earnings.
Based on the weekly 
AAPL
 Weekly Jun29 $148 straddle, the

A class-action lawsuit was filed today against Apple accusing the company of illegally profiting from payment card issuers through its Apple Pay policies, allegedly extracting up to $1 billion annually in fees in violation of federal antitrust law, according to attorneys at Hagens Berman and Sperling & Slater.
The lawsuit seeks to represent a class of U.S. credit unions and financial institutions that issue payment cards enabled for use in Apple Pay. The class action was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California and accuses Apple of denying rivals access to the technology needed to develop a competing mobile wallet.
On iOS devices, Apple has ensured that only its mobile wallet, Apple Pay, can make contactless payments at the point of sale.
Having secured a monopoly for Apple Pay in this fashion, Apple charges card issuers who use Apple Pay supracompetitive fees for a service that is available on Android devices for free, according to the lawsuit.

 TF International's Ming-Chi Kuo says, ""I recently talked to distributors/retailers/scalpers in China again, and they said they felt that the potential demand for the iPhone 14 series in China is continuing to increase. A possible explanation is that Apple almost dominates the entire Chinese high-end smartphone market after Huawei quit the 5G smartphone market, which also means that the number of potential high-end iPhone users has increased in the Chinese market. At present, in the Chinese market, the iPhone 14 prepaid deposit is significantly higher than the iPhone 13 and even twice as high in some areas. The iPhone 14 shipment forecast of component suppliers and EMS is about 100 million and 90 million units in 2H22, respectively.

Apple (
AAPL
) 
is trading modestly higher after the company reported Q2 (Mar) results last night. The quarter's headline numbers were decent, and the company also announced a 5% increase to its dividend and added $90 bln to its share repurchase program. However, certain cautious comments about Q3 (Jun) are keeping keep a lid on the stock today. 
The headline numbers included solid beats
 on EPS and revenue. After missing a couple of quarters ago, Apple has now rebounded with sturdy upside in back-to-back quarters. 
iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Services all performed better
 than analyst expectations (see 16:38 InPlay comment for specific comparisons) despite supply constraints. Results for Wearables were maybe a slight miss, but that blemish was minor overall. 
 As a standout, iPhone revenue grew 5% yr/yr to $50.57 bln, well ahead of expectations. Analysts had been expecting the category to post a slight decline due to supply constraint concerns and the impact of lapping a tough comparison from the prior-year period. iPhone is by far Apple's largest category (52% of total revs), so its unexpected growth was particularly welcome. 
The Wearables segment, which reported somewhat underwhelming results, has doubled in three years and is nearly the size of a Fortune 100 business in its own right, posting $8.81 bln in MarQ revs. Apple believes that it can pursue substantial growth by attracting customers who are new to Wearables. For example, over two-thirds of customers purchasing an Apple Watch are new to the product. 
So, why is the stock not higher? 
We view Apple's cautious comments about JunQ as the main problem. Apple did not provide specific guidance, but it expects JunQ to be more severely impacted by supply constraints caused by COVID-related disruptions and industry-wide silicon shortages. Demand remains robust, but disruptions are making it harder to meet customer demand. Apple anticipates that constraints could impact revenue in the $4-8 bln range, which is substantially larger than the MarQ impact. 
 
Overall, we are not seeing a lot wrong with the MarQ results. 
In fact, we are impressed that the numbers were this good considering the supply constraints. The JunQ comments were troubling, although not entirely unexpected given the COVID lockdowns in China. Investors may have been expecting and pricing in cautious guidance, which may explain why the stock is holding up fairly well in the wake of the company's earnings press.

  (159.27

)
Apple (
AAPL
) will report second quarter (Mar) earnings
tonight after the close. 
Q2 Capital IQ consensus calls for EPS of $1.43 (versus
$1.40 last year) on revenue of $93.993 billion (+5% yr/yr).
 The Street is
expecting Q2 gross margins of 43.2% versus 42.5% last year (guidance
42.5-43.5%).
The company has not provided exact guidance since the pandemic
began. It will be interesting when and if the company starts providing exact
guidance again. 
Q3 (Jun) Capital IQ consensus calls for EPS of $1.24 &
$85.96 bln. The Street is expecting Q3 gross margins of 43.1% versus 43.3% last
year.
On the last conference call, the company said it expects ""solid"" Q2
revenue growth, but growth rate will be less than growth rate of December
quarter (Note: December quarter revenue growth was 11.3%). The company expects
strong double-digit growth in services, but growth will decelerate from growth
in December quarter because customers are spending less time at home.
 Supply
chain issues in Q2 (March) were expected to be less at the time of the
conference call. However, this was before the lockdowns in Shanghai.
The Street is expecting Q2 iPhone revenue of $47.7 bln versus $47.9 bln last
year.
 Q2 iPad revenue of $7.2 bln versus $7.8 bln last year. Q2 Services
revenue of $19.6 bln versus $19.1 bln last year. Q2 wearables revenue of $8.9
bln versus $7.8 bln last year. Q2 Mac revenue of $9.4 bln versus $9.1 bln last
year.
The company is expected to update its dividend and share repurchase
program
.  Last year, the company
increased its dividend 7% to $0.22/share. The board of directors has also
authorized an increase of $90 billion to the existing share repurchase program.
The company missed on revenues once over the last four
quarters. Regarding Q1, iPhone, Mac, and wearables sales all exceeded analyst
expectations. iPad results, however, fell short. Demand remains robust, but
that product faced the most severe component shortages. Services revenue was
basically in-line, maybe a slight miss.
AAPL
 has a $2.60 trillion valuation and currently trades at
26 times FY22 earnings.
Based on the weekly 
AAPL
 Weekly Apr30 $160 straddle, the
options market is currently pricing in a move of ~5% in either direction by
weekly expiration (Friday).

""In a decision issued today by the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (the ""CAFC""), the three-judge panel ruled in WiLAN's favour regarding several of WiLAN's arguments. First, the CAFC agreed with WiLAN's claim construction arguments relating to the patents-in-suit. Second, the CAFC ruled in WiLAN's favour with respect to WiLAN's infringement related arguments. Notably, Apple did not appeal the lower court's decision that WiLAN's patents are valid over the prior art. With these two rulings today, the CAFC has conclusively decided that Apple infringes the patents-in-suit and is liable to pay damages to WiLAN.  In addition, the CAFC also ruled in WiLAN's favour regarding a prior license agreement between Intel Corp. (
INTC
) and WiLAN. This prior license was dealt with in a summary judgment of non-infringement decision previously issued by the United States District Court of the Southern District of California (the ""District Court"") from which this appeal was being heard..."" 
""In that summary judgment ruling, the District Court had ruled that Apple products using Intel wireless chips should be excluded from the damages calculations that were awarded to WiLAN. In its ruling today, the CAFC disagreed with that District Court decision and instead agreed with WiLAN's position, making Intel-based Apple products available for inclusion in a final damages award.  Finally, the CAFC ruled against WiLAN with respect to certain assumptions made by WiLAN's damages expert in calculating the damages amount that was presented to the jury. As a result, the CAFC has remanded the case back to the District Court for another trial focusing on the amount of damages that Apple will be required to pay.""

  (166.12 
+6.90
)
After a rough Q4 (Sep), 
Apple (
AAPL
 166.12, +6.90, +4.3%)
 bounced back with a nice upside result in Q1 (Dec). As important as the report's EPS and revenue numbers were, we think Apple's commentary on supply constraints was even better music to investors' ears. 
 
The headline numbers featured solid beats
 on EPS and revenue, constituting a big improvement from SepQ's in-line EPS result. 
 
iPhone, Mac, and Wearables sales all exceeded analyst expectations.
 iPad results, however, fell short. Demand remains robust, but that product faced the most severe component shortages. Services revenue was basically in-line, maybe a slight miss. 
iPhone sales were boosted by the launch of iPhone 13.
 Revenue climbed 9% yr/yr to an all-time record of $71.6 bln, despite supply constraints. 
 
Mac revenue was the biggest growth category
, up 25% yr/yr to $10.9 bln, also an all-time record, despite supply constraints. Apple is seeing strong demand for its newly redesigned MacBook Pro. Of note, Apple is now one year into its transition to Apple silicon, and already the vast majority of Mac sales are from M1-powered devices. 
iPad was the main trouble area. 
Its sales fell 14% yr/yr to $7.25 bln due to significant supply constraints. The good news here is that iPad is by far Apple's smallest category at 6% of total sales; iPhone, meanwhile, accounts for 58% of sales. 
The supply constraints have been long forecast by Apple
, so their impact does not come as a big surprise. Apple warned about component shortages on its earnings call in late July, expecting the constraints to primarily impact iPhone and iPad. Then during its SepQ call in October, Apple said that constraints would cause a larger hit to DecQ revs than the $6 bln experienced in SepQ. During the Q&A, Apple conceded that did happen.
 
The good news today is
 that Apple now expects fewer supply constraints in MarQ than it had in DecQ. 
 
Bottom line, this DecQ report was welcome after the rough SepQ.
 Demand remains robust across the board, and iPhone 13 sales were strong. A takeaway here is that even a tech behemoth like Apple is not immune from the global component shortage. The timing of the shortage was unfortunate, as it hit just as Apple introduced its iPhone 13 lineup as well as the Apple Watch Series 7, new iPad, and iPad mini, all of which represent significant advances. 
However, investors should take comfort in the prospect that supply constraint issues should ease up in MarQ for Apple. We had trepidation heading into this report after 
Intel (INTC)
 pushed back its timeline for supply constraint improvement on Wednesday. Intel now expects ecosystem constraints to persist through 2022 and into 2023 vs prior guidance for gradual improvement heading into 2022. So, we take Apple's outlook as a win. It's also good news for Apple suppliers like 
SWKS, QRVO, CRUS, AVGO, TSM, QCOM, SMH, LPL, LITE, FNSR, 
and 
IIVI
. Many of those names will report over the coming weeks.

  (161.80 
+2.10
)
Apple (
AAPL
) will report first quarter FY22 earnings tonight
after the close. There is a conference call scheduled for 17:00 ET. 
Q1 Capital
IQ consensus calls for EPS of $1.89 versus $1.69 last year on revenue of $118.5
bln (+6% yr/yr). 
The Street is expecting Q1 gross margins of 41.6% versus 39.8%
last year. 
The company has not provided exact guidance since the pandemic
began
. It will be interesting when and if the company starts providing exact
guidance again. Q2 Capital IQ consensus calls for EPS of $1.32 and revenues of
$90.2 bln. The Street is expecting Q2 gross margins of 42.1%.
On the Q4 conference call, the company said supply chain and chip supply issues
had a $6 billion revenue impact in Q4. The company estimates that impact from
supply chain and chip supply issues will be ""larger"" in Q1. The
company expects Q1 revenue growth in each product category with the exception
of iPad. It expects Q1 services revenue growth to slow from Q4.
The Street is expecting Q1 iPhone revenue of $67.5 bln vs. $65.6 bln last year,
Mac revenue of $9.5 bln versus $8.7 bln last year, iPad revenue of $7.8 bln vs.
$8.4 bln last year, wearables revenue of $14.0 bln versus $13.0 bln last year,
and services revenue of $19.7 bln versus $15.8 bln last year.
The company missed on revenues for the first time in several quarters last
quarter. In Q4, iPhone revenue jumped 47% yr/yr to $38.9 bln but was light of
consensus. Just as iPhone 12 was more of a DecQ story last year, so will iPhone
13 be this year due to supply constraints. Meanwhile, Wearables and Mac sales
also were light. The only category to beat expectations was iPad; Services were
in-line. Demand is not an issue; in fact, Apple described demand as robust in
SepQ. The quarter's main challenge was larger than expected supply constraints.

)
There is always one bad 
Apple (
AAPL
 -4%)
 in every bunch. While Apple normally reports great earnings every quarter, the company last night closed out FY21 with a bit of a stinker. 
 
The headline numbers were neither awful nor great
 for Q4 (Sep) as the company showed that even it is not immune from supply constraint pressures. Apple reported in-line EPS, which, given the company's sterling track record for big beats, is something of a letdown. Furthermore, the quarter's revenue, despite being a SepQ record, was light of consensus for the first time since MarQ2017. 
Demand is not an issue; 
in fact, Apple described demand as robust in SepQ. The quarter's main challenge was larger than expected supply constraints. Apple estimates that these constraints had a $6 bln revenue impact, driven primarily by industry-wide silicon shortages and COVID-related manufacturing disruptions. Nevertheless, Apple set an all-time record for Mac sales and quarterly records for iPhone, iPad, Wearables, Home and Accessories, representing 30% yr/yr growth in products. Its Services business outperformed internal expectations, achieving an all-time record of $18.3 bln, up 26% yr/yr. 
iPhone revenue jumped 47% yr/yr to $38.9 bln but was light of consensus. 
Just as iPhone 12 was more of a DecQ story last year, so will iPhone 13 be this year due to supply constraints. Meanwhile, Wearables and Mac sales also were light. The only category to beat expectations was iPad; Services were in-line. 
These weak results were not entirely a surprise.
 Apple warned about component shortages during its earnings call in late July, saying that supply constraints during SepQ would likely be greater than JunQ, with the constraints primarily impacting iPhone and iPad. A Bloomberg article a few weeks ago said that Apple was likely to slash iPhone 13 production targets due to chip shortages. 
What is a surprise is the greater-than-expected severity
 of the supply issues; furthermore, Apple said during the Q&A that constraints will cause a larger hit to Q1 (Dec) revs than the $6 bln experienced in SepQ. 
Bottom line, this report shows that even a tech behemoth like Apple is not immune
 from the global chip shortage. The timing of the shortage is unfortunate, as it's coming just as Apple introduced its iPhone 13 lineup as well as the Apple Watch Series 7, new iPad, and iPad mini, all of which represent significant advances. It's also bad news for Apple suppliers like 
SWKS, QRVO, CRUS, AVGO, TSM, QCOM, SMH, LPL, LITE, FNSR

Apple (

after the close. There is a conference call scheduled for 17:00 ET. The key
question will be if the company will provide exact Q4 guidance which it has
refrained from doing since the pandemic began. The company also could provide more
vague guidance on Q4 during its conference call. 
 
Q4 Capital IQ consensus calls for EPS of $1.24
(versus $0.65 last year) on revenue of $85.0 bln (+31% yr/yr). Q1 Capital IQ
consensus calls for revenues of $119.2 bln (+6.5% yr/yr).
The iPhone 13 was released on September 24 this year, which was the tail end of
the fourth quarter. Last year, the iPhone 13 came out in October, which could
account for the larger than usual expected year/year Q4 growth rate. Key
concerns that could be addressed on the conference call could be how the chip
shortage is impacting the company and if the company is keeping up with demand.
The Street is expecting Q4 iPhone revenue of $41.7 bln vs.
$26.4 bln last year; 
Q4 iPad revenue of $7.5 bln vs. $6.8 bln last year; Q4
wearables revenue of $9.4 bln vs. $7.9 bln last year; services revenue of $18.3 bln vs $14.5 bln last year; Mac revenue of $9.6 bln vs. $9.0 bln last
year.  
The Street is expecting Q4 gross
margins of 41.9% versus 38.2% last year. Q1 gross margins are expected to be
40.4% versus 39.8% last year.
The company has not missed EPS or revenues in several quarters.
In Q1, Apple performed very well across its bevy of offerings with strong
double-digit growth despite supply constraints in several product categories.

iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro Max
: Both models introduce an all-new Super Retina XDR display with ProMotion featuring an adaptive refresh rate up to 120Hz, making the touch experience faster and more responsive. The pro camera system gets its biggest advancement ever with new Ultra Wide, Wide, and Telephoto cameras that capture stunning photos and video, powered by the unmatched performance of A15 Bionic, more powerful than the leading competition. These technologies enable impressive new photo capabilities never before possible on iPhone, like macro photography on the new Ultra Wide camera and up to 2.2x improved low-light performance on the new Wide camera. New computational photography features like Photographic Styles personalize the look of images in the Camera app, and both models now include Night mode on all cameras. Video takes a huge leap forward with Cinematic mode for beautiful depth-of-field transitions, macro video, Time-lapse and Slo-mo, and even better low-light performance. Both models also offer end-to-end pro workflows in Dolby Vision, and for the first time, ProRes, only available on iPhone. iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro Max also include 5G with more bands for better coverage, big improvements to battery life for the best battery life ever on iPhone with iPhone 13 Pro Max, new storage capacity of 1TB, and the Ceramic Shield front cover, tougher than any smartphone glass. Pre-orders begin Friday, September 17, with 
availability beginning Friday, September 24. 
iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 mini
: Featuring a beautiful design with sleek flat edges in five gorgeous 
new colors. Both models feature major innovations, including the most advanced 
dual-camera system ever on iPhone — with a new Wide camera with bigger pixels 
and sensor-shift optical image stabilization (OIS) offering improvements in low-light photos and 
videos, a new way to personalize the camera with Photographic Styles, and 
Cinematic mode, which brings a new dimension to video storytelling. iPhone 13 
and iPhone 13 mini also boast super-fast performance and power efficiency with 
A15 Bionic, longer battery life, a brighter 
Super Retina XDR display that brings content to life, incredible durability 
with the Ceramic Shield front cover, double the entry-level storage at 128GB, 
an industry-leading IP68 rating for water resistance, and an advanced 5G 
experience. Customers can get iPhone 13 for $33.29

before trade-in, and iPhone 13 mini for $29.12 (US) a month for 24 months or $699 (US) before trade-in 
Apple Watch Series 7
: Featuring a reengineered Always-On Retina display with 
significantly more screen area and thinner borders, making it the largest and 
most advanced display ever. The narrower borders allow the display to maximize 
screen area, while minimally changing the dimensions of the watch itself. The 
design of Apple Watch Series 7 is refined with softer, more rounded corners, and 
the display has a unique refractive edge that makes full-screen watch faces and 
apps appear to seamlessly connect with the curvature of the case. Apple Watch Series 7 also features a user interface optimized for the larger display, offering greater readability and ease of use, plus two unique watch faces — Contour and Modular Duo — designed specifically for the new device. With the improvements to the display, users benefit from the same all-day 18-hour battery life,1 now complemented by 33 percent faster charging. All Apple Watch Series 7 models will be available later this fall.  Apple Watch Series 7 will start at $399 (US), Apple Watch SE starts at $279 (US), and Apple Watch Series 3 starts at $199 (US).

Fitness+ is also introducing a new program — Workouts to Get Ready for Snow Season — featuring and designed with two-time Olympic gold medalist and five-time world champion skier Ted Ligety, along with Fitness+ trainer Anja Garcia. Inspired by winter sports, the program will help build strength, balance, and endurance so users can have more fun on the slopes, all the way to the last run.

  (143.08 
-3.69
)
Apple (
AAPL
 -2.5%)
 is very ""a-peeling"" today following another impressive earnings report. The headline numbers were quite good for Q3 (Jun). Apple reported a huge $0.29 EPS beat — not quite up to levels of last quarter's $0.42 upside, but still very good. Probably even more impressive was revenue jumping 36.4% yr/yr to a JunQ record of $81.43 bln, well above the $73.48 bln consensus. 
 Apple grew double-digits in each of its product categories. It posted an all-time record for services and JunQ records for iPhone, Mac, and Wearables, Home and Accessories. Apple also set new JunQ records in every geographic segment, recording strong double-digit growth in each one of them. iPhone sales jumped 50% yr/yr to $39.57 bln vs $33.5 bln ests; Mac sales rose 16% yr/yr to $8.24 bln vs $7.7 bln ests; iPad sales rose 12% yr/yr to $7.37 bln vs $6.4 bln ests; Wearables sales rose 36% yr/yr to $8.78 bln vs $7.8 bln ests; and, finally, Services revenue rose 33% yr/yr to $17.49 bln vs $16.7 bln ests. 
Key takeaways from the quarter:
 
It is remarkable that iPhone sales were still so robust. iPhone 12 continues to sell well. We would have expected more of a lull given that iPhone 13 will likely make its debut in a few months. 
 iPad had its highest JunQ in nearly a decade while Mac set an all-time JunQ record. Apple has seen a great response to the new iMac and iPad Pro, both powered by the M1 chip. 
 Services set a new all-time revenue record as Apple continues to roll out new features and programming. Apple TV+ users are loving series like 
Mythic Quest
 and 
Ted Lasso
. 
We were disappointed that Apple continued its policy of not providing specific guidance. Blaming the pandemic is starting to feel a bit dated. Hopefully, when the new fiscal year kicks in, it will start to provide guidance again. Apple did say it expects very strong double-digit yr/yr revenue growth in Q4 (Sep), although it expects growth will be lower than JunQ's 36% growth. 
 Growth in SepQ is likely to be impacted by less favorable foreign exchange rates. Is services growth rate should return to a more typical level (JunQ was lapping easier pandemic comps). Apple also expects supply constraints during SepQ to be greater than those experienced during JunQ. The constraints will primarily impact iPhone and iPad. 
Overall, this was a typically great quarter for Apple.
 The stock is slightly lower despite the good numbers. We think that's because the stock had run by 17% since early June, so good results were likely priced in already. Also, Apple's comments about more severe supply constraints in SepQ may be weighing on the name a bit, especially as they pertain to iPhones and iPads. The timing of the constraints relative to the likely launch of the iPhone 13 this fall is not ideal, and the constraints may also shave a few points off what's expected to be a big back-to-school season as students finally return to the classroom this fall.

Cowen expects ""
AAPL
 to report Jun '21 quarter (F3Q21) in line with consensus driven by steady 5G iPhone and strong Mac & iPad demand that was tempered by product availability due to the ongoing chip supply tightness. Similar to prior quarters and in lieu of formal guidance, they expect management to provide a broad range and qualitative color for the Sep Q. With the launch of the upcoming new iPhone expected in September, they expect the 5G upgrade cycle will continue to drive healthy Y/Y growth into CY22 while Mac & iPad supply is likely to continue to fall short of market demand. Sentiment wise, they believe investors are increasingly weighing FY22's EPS growth potential given tough comps for the hardware businesses.""

  (134.11

)
Apple (
AAPL
) 
is tasting delicious to investors today after reporting impressive Q2 (Mar) earnings results last night. The headline numbers were quite good. Apple reported a huge $0.42 EPS beat, well ahead of the $0.27 beat reported last quarter. Probably even more impressive was revenue jumping 53.6% yr/yr to a new MarQ record high of $89.58 bln, well above the $76.84 bln consensus. Mac and Services delivered all-time record results, and Apple set new MarQ records for iPhone and Wearables sales. 
 Apple performed very well across its bevy of offerings, with strong double-digit growth in several product categories: iPhone sales jumped 66% yr/yr to $47.9 bln vs. $41.0 bln estimates; Mac sales jumped 70% yr/yr to $9.1 bln vs $6.6 bln ests; iPad sales increased 79% yr/yr to $7.8 bln vs $5.7 bln ests; Wearables sales rose 25% yr/yr to $7.8 bln vs $7.6 bln ests; and finally, Services revenue rose 27% yr/yr to $16.9 bln vs $15.7 bln ests. 
Key takeaways from the quarter:
 
The iPhone 12 launched in DecQ, but there was a spillover effect into MarQ. The model, Apple's first 5G phone, has been very popular with both upgraders and new customers. This is great news for iPhone suppliers, including 
QCOM 
and 
CRUS
. 
iPad and Mac sales have been fueled by the pandemic. Over the past year, tens of millions of iPads and Macs have been sold to help students learn and employees work remotely. 
It was great to see Mac sales snap back with a huge quarter. Mac sales were a bit light in DecQ, likely on some pull-forward sales in SepQ due to back-to-school and remote learning. However, taking the three most recent quarters together, this was Mac's best three-quarter period ever. 
 One area of disappointment may be Apple's decision to continue not providing guidance. On the call, the company guided to strong double-digit revenue growth, but the outlook was not very specific. Given how strong sales have been and in light of the economy re-opening, we think it's time Apple starts guiding again. Blaming the pandemic is starting to feel a bit dated. 
Overall, this was a great quarter for Apple. 
It was great to see upside sales in all categories. Sometimes Apple can stumble a bit, like it did last quarter with Macs, but MarQ was uniformly good. The iPhone 12 launch was a big success that spilled over into MarQ. Our one concern is whether we'll see any turbulence in Mac and iPad sales in the next few quarters as we lap the start of the pandemic. This is where guidance would have been helpful. Nevertheless, Apple's MarQ results were impressive.

Apple (
AAPL
) reports second quarter earnings tonight after the close. 
Q2 Capital IQ consensus calls for EPS of $0.99 (versus $0.64 last year) on revenue of $77.3 bln (+32 yr/yr).
 
The key question will be if the company will provide Q3 guidance which it has refrained from doing since the pandemic began. The company also could provide some other details on Q3 during its conference call. Q3 Capital IQ consensus calls for EPS of $0.82 (versus $0.65 last year) on revenue of $68.58 bln (+15% yr/yr) and gross margins of 39.7% versus 38% last year.
The Street is expecting Q2 iPhones revenue to be $41.0 bln vs. $28.9 bln last year, 
iPad revenues to be $5.7 bln vs. $4.4 bln last year, Mac revenues of $6.6 bln vs. $5.4 bln last year, wearable revenues of $7.6 bln vs. $6.3 bln last year, and service revenue of $15.7 bln vs. $13.4 bln last year. The Street is expecting Q2 gross margins of 40% versus 38.4% last year.
In addition, Apple is expected to update its dividend and its share repurchase program.
 Last year, the company raised the dividend by 6% to $0.82/share and added $50 bln to its share repurchase program.
The company has not missed EPS or revenues in several quarters. In Q1, Apple performed very well across its bevy of offerings with strong double-digit growth despite supply constraints in several product categories: Apple reported Q1 iPhone revenue of $65.6 bln (+17% yr/yr), iPads revenue of $8.4 (+41% yr/yr), Services revenue $15.8 bln (+24% yr/yr), and wearables revenue of $13.0 bln (+30% yr/yr).
Citigroup analyst Jim Suva commented, ""Apple's shares have underperformed the broader markets but this follows significant outperformance in CY 2020. Aside from broader macro rotation, underperformance can be attributed to news flow on order cuts (mainly tied to iPhone 12 mini) and uncertainty around iPhone demand momentum, as well as antitrust concerns that could potentially derail Services growth momentum and negatively impact earnings. Our checks continue to suggest underlying demand fundamentals across consumer tech demand and App Store remains robust....""

Apple today announced that over 110 of its manufacturing partners around the world are moving to 100% renewable energy for their Apple production, with nearly 8 gigawatts of planned clean energy set to come online. Once completed, these commitments will avoid over 15 mln metric tons of CO2e annually.
 Additionally, Apple is investing directly in renewable energy projects to cover a portion of upstream emissions, as well as a major energy storage project in California to pilot new solutions for renewable infrastructure.
Apple is constructing one of the largest battery projects in the country, California Flats -- a grid-scale energy storage project capable of storing 240 megawatt-hours of energy, enough to power over 7,000 homes for one day. This project supports the company's 130-megawatt solar farm that provides all of its renewable energy in California, by storing excess energy generated during the day and deploying it when it is most needed.

Apple (
AAPL
 -2%)
 is not tasting very good to investors despite reporting impressive Q1 (Dec) earnings results. Apple cleared the $100 bln mark in quarterly sales for the first time ever and reported consistently good results in almost every product category. However, investors do not seem overly enthused.
  The headline numbers were quite good. Apple rebounded from a modest $0.03 beat in SepQ to post a good-sized $0.27 beat in DecQ. Also, revenue jumped 21.4% yr/yr to $111.4 bln, well above the $103.24 bln consensus. Everyone expected the company to report robust iPhone sales given that Apple launched its first-ever 5G iPhone in the quarter, and Apple delivered: iPhone revs reached $65.6 bln vs. $59.9 bln estimates. 
 Apple performed very well across its bevy of non-iPhone offerings, reporting strong double-digit growth in several product categories: iPad revs of $8.44 bln (+41% yr/yr; +24% sequentially) vs. $7.5 bln ests; wearables of $12.97 bln (+30% yr/yr) vs. $11.6 bln ests; Macs of $8.68 bln (+21% yr/yr) vs. $8.8 bln ests; and Services of $15.76 bln (+24% yr/yr) vs $15.0 bln. 
So, why is the stock not up strongly today?
 
Mac sales were a bit light. 
The 21% yr/yr growth was below SepQ's 29% growth to $9.03 bln, and it was slightly below analyst expectations for DecQ. However, this was not a huge surprise to us after 
Microsoft's (MSFT) 
earnings report this week. Surface also saw a slowdown in sales. This makes sense given that SepQ included the back-to-school season, which was fueled by purchases made to meet the demands of remote learning. 
Investors are likely disappointed that Apple has yet to resume its practice of providing guidance.
 We figured that with a new fiscal year getting underway, perhaps Apple would start guiding again. Apple's decision to continue not providing guidance may be weighing on the stock. 
 
Retail investors have found other shiny new objects to play with.
 The massive short squeezes in GME, AMC, and others seem to be siphoning interest/headlines away from Apple's strong results. 
It's a bit of sell-the-news reaction 
given Apple's +22% surge since Thanksgiving. Everyone knew it'd be a strong quarter given the iPhone launch, and the report is being seen as an opportunity to book some profits. 
Overall, this was a great quarter for Apple despite the stock's reaction today. The iPhone 12 launch was a big success. In most years, new iPhone models include just incremental improvements, like better chips or superior cameras. This year was a big step up, as Apple finally launched its long-awaited 5G iPhone. However, Mac sales coming in a bit light and a lack of guidance is causing investors to cash in on recent gains.

Apple (
AAPL
) will report first quarter earnings tomorrow
before the open. 
Q1 Capital IQ consensus calls for EPS of $1.41 (+13% yr/yr) on
revenue of $103.2 bln (+12.4% yr/yr). The Street is expecting Q1 gross margins
of 37.9% versus 38,4% last year. 
The Street is expecting Q1 iPhone revenues of
$59.9 bln (+7%), $7.5 bln in iPad revenues (+27%), $8.8 bln in Mac revenues
(+23%), $15.0 bln in services revenues (+18% yr/yr), and $11.6 bln in wearables
revenues (+16%).
The most important data point will be iPhone sales as the new iPhone 12 and
iPhone 12 Pro models were released in the first quarter.  
The company is expected to guide for second
quarter revenues of $74.1 bln (+27% yr/yr).
 
The company has not missed EPS or revenues in several quarters. In Q4, Apple
performed very well across its bevy of non-iPhone offerings with strong
double-digit growth despite supply constraints in several product categories:
iPad revs of $6.80 bln (+46% yr/yr) vs. $6.20 ests; Wearables of $7.88 bln
(+21% yr/yr) vs. $7.6 bln ests; Mac revs of $9.03 bln (+29% yr/yr); Services of
$14.55 bln (+16% yr/yr).
Earlier this month, Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives wrote ""We believe Apple saw a
robust holiday season not just on iPhones, but also had a strong AirPods
performance that will be another product tailwind for Cook & Co. For the
March quarter we believe builds for total iPhones ticked up again another 5%
over the last few weeks and are now in the 60 million to 70 million range. For
the June quarter we believe initial builds are in the low 40 million range with
potentially an upward bias.""
