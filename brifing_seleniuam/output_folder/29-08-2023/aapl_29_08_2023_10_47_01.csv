"04-Aug-23  09:53 ET","AAPL","Apple's lighter-than-expected iPhone growth and disappointing SepQ guidance takes a bite out of shares today
  (185.40 
-5.77
)
The unfavorable macroeconomic climate took a bite out of 
Apple (
AAPL
 -2%) 
in Q3 (Jun). The iPhone maker did register decent earnings upside and in-line revs in the quarter. However, iPhone sales came up short of analyst expectations. Other products, including iPad and wearables, also took a hit as challenging yr/yr comparisons and FX headwinds added further obstacles. Discouragingly, Apple expects similar sales performance to the 1.4% decline from JunQ in Q4 (Sep), below what analysts forecasted. 
 iPhone revenue slipped by 2% yr/yr in JunQ to $39.7 bln. However, on a constant currency basis, iPhone saw positive growth in the quarter, setting JunQ records in several emerging markets, such as India, which Apple has noted is at a tipping point, and Mexico. iPhone also overcame a difficult demand environment in parts of Europe, setting records across France, the Netherlands, and Austria. 
Unlike last quarter, Mac revenue of $6.8 bln, a 7% dip, topped estimates in JunQ. Apple's transition to running its entire Mac lineup on its in-house silicon likely helped boost Mac sales, given the enormous jump in processing power over previous 
Intel (INTC)
 chips.
Conversely, iPad sales continued to underperform, tumbling 20% yr/yr to $5.8 bln. The lackluster growth stemmed partly from an unfavorable yr/yr comparison when Apple launched the revamped iPad Air. Although iPad comprises the smallest chunk of total revenue, it tends to be the device that attracts first-time customers into the Apple ecosystem, given the poor selection of competing tablets and frustrating Android 
(GOOG) 
support. With iPad more discretionary than a phone or computer, the demand backdrop could hinder new customer growth over the near term. 
However, wearables, including the Apple Watch, which, albeit missed sales estimates,  could fill this void. CFO Luca Maestri mentioned that roughly two-thirds of customers purchasing an Apple Watch were new to the product. When considering one of the best smartwatches to own, the Apple Watch typically tops the leaderboards. Since the best experience on an Apple Watch requires an iPhone, a potential Apple Watch buyer must also consider purchasing an iPhone. 
While product revenue was down 4% yr/yr, Services revenue growth accelerated to +8%, up from the +5% posted in MarQ, reflecting the strength of Apple's ecosystem. As Apple bolsters its global presence, more users are exposed to the numerous services offered through Apple products, including Apple Arcade, Apple TV, and Apple Card, which is required to set up a high-yield savings account that has seen over $10 bln in deposits since its Spring launch. 
Apple's JunQ report was mostly upbeat, containing several highlights from emerging market strength to accelerating Services growth. However, alongside weak iPhone sales, SepQ guidance translates to a possible fourth-straight quarter of declining revenue, a concerning development. Prominent suppliers 
Taiwan Semi (TSM)
 and 
Qualcomm (QCOM)
 have also warned about lingering global demand weakness for the remainder of the year, setting up for a potentially challenging 1Q24 (Dec) for Apple as well. Still, over the longer term, Apple is cementing itself as a leader in consumer tech, with the capacity to expand sales considerably with the upcoming launch of Apple Vision Pro early next year.

Apple (
AAPL
 +5%) 
is trading nicely higher after reporting Q2 (Mar) results last night. The headline numbers of a nice EPS beat and upside revenue were quite good, especially in light of macro and FX headwinds. After production headaches due to China COVID shutdowns in DecQ, Apple says that supply was not a problem in MarQ. Apple also announced a $90 bln share repurchase program and hiked the dividend by 4%. 
iPhone was the star of the show
 with revenue coming in much better than expected. Revenue rose 1.5% yr/yr to $51.33 bln, a record iPhone result for MarQ. Apple says iPhone 14 continues to delight users with its long-lasting battery and advanced camera. Apple said that production issues in DecQ may have pushed some sales into MarQ. iPhone outperformance helped to offset weakness in other areas. 
 
Probably the biggest disappointment was Mac sales
, which fell 31% yr/yr to $7.17 bln, which was below street estimates. In fairness, Mac was lapping a very difficult compare last year which included the incredibly successful rollout of its M1 chips throughout its Mac lineup. However, Apple also conceded that Mac faced some macroeconomic and FX headwinds. 
iPad revenue fell 13%
 yr/yr at $6.67 bln, which was in-line with street ests, Similar to Mac, iPad revenue was hurt by macro and FX challenges as well as lapping the M1-powered iPad Air last year. 
 
Wearables revenue was flat
 yr/yr at $8.76 bln, which was slight upside. Wearables was up 5% to $20.9 bln, which was a bit light but not bad. 
 
Emerging Markets was another important topic
 with India being described as an ""incredibly exciting market"" and a major focus for Apple. It just launched its first two Apple stores there, one in Mumbai and one in Delhi. CEO Tim Cook visited and saw a lot of excitement firsthand. There are a lot of people coming into the middle-class, and Apple feels that India is at a tipping point. Apple also had a stellar quarter in other emerging markets, with records set in several countries. 
Overall, it was a solid quarter but pretty much as expected. 
Strong iPhone revenue helped to offset some weakness in Macs an iPads. The sizeable buyback authorization and dividend hike were a nice bonus. 
All eyes now turn to WWDC
, Apple's annual Worldwide Developers Conference in early June. Excitement is building for what is expected to be the launch of Apple's AR/VR headset, which would be a new product category for Apple. The first headsets are expected to be pretty pricey with cheaper versions likely in the next couple of years. 
Apple shares have been on a nice uptrend, up nearly 40% from their January lows and the stock is flirting a new 52-week high today. Suppliers to keep on note include:

Apple today announced a major expansion of its Restore Fund, doubling the company's total commitment to advancing high-quality, nature-based carbon removal projects. First launched in 2021 with an up to $200 million commitment with Conservation International and Goldman Sachs, the Restore Fund is now set to grow with an additional fund, including new investment from Apple, and a new portfolio of carbon removal projects. Apple created the Restore Fund to encourage global investment to protect and restore critical ecosystems and scale natural carbon removal solutions. This approach also helps address residual emissions businesses cannot yet avoid or reduce with existing technology. 
As part of the expansion, Apple will invest up to an additional $200 million in the new fund, which Climate Asset Management — a joint venture of HSBC Asset Management (
HSBC 
unit) and Pollination — will manage. The new portfolio also aims to remove 1 million metric tons of carbon dioxide per year at its peak while generating a financial return for investors. For Apple suppliers that become partners in the fund, it will also offer a new way for them to incorporate high-impact carbon removal projects as they decarbonize.

  (147.92)
Today's Statement of Objections clarifies that the Commission does no longer take a position as to the legality of the IAP obligation for the purposes of this antitrust investigation but rather focuses on the contractual restrictions that Apple imposed on app developers which prevent them from informing iPhone and iPad users of alternative music subscription options at lower prices outside of the app and to effectively choose those.
The Commission takes the preliminary view that Apple's anti-steering obligations are unfair trading conditions in breach of Article 102 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.
In particular, the Commission is concerned that the anti-steering obligations imposed by Apple on music streaming app developers prevent those developers from informing consumers about where and how to subscribe to streaming services at lower prices.  These anti-steering obligations: (i) are neither necessary nor proportionate for the provision of the App Store on iPhones and iPads; (ii) are detrimental to users of music streaming services on Apple's mobile devices who may end up paying more; and (iii) negatively affect the interests of music streaming app developers by limiting effective consumer choice.

"03-Feb-23  09:53 ET","AAPL","Apple recoups earlier losses as investors keep the spotlight on the many bright spots in DecQ
  (151.87 
+1.05
)
Apple (
AAPL
)
 is amid a strong comeback today despite registering top- and bottom-line misses in Q1 (Dec) due to a continually unfavorable macroeconomic environment. Also, the tech giant forecasted Q2 (Mar) sales performance to mirror Q1, translating to another rare yr/yr decline and below analyst projections.
  In addition to weakening consumer sentiment, 
AAPL
 faced other challenges outside its control in Q1, including a relatively strong U.S. dollar and supply chain constraints. These headwinds resulted in adjusted earnings slipping by 10.5% yr/yr to $1.88 and revs sinking by 5.5% to $117.15 bln, 
AAPL
's first quarterly decline since 2Q19 (Mar). Additionally, the revenue from iPhones, Macs, and wearables missed analyst estimates in the quarter. 
 However, despite the tepid headline results and climbing over 20% to start the year, shares are holding up nicely today, recouping their initial losses. 
 A significant factor buoying the stock was that 
AAPL
 has more of a supply problem than a demand one, similar to last quarter. iPhone supply could not keep pace with demand in Q1, causing ship times to extend well beyond what 
AAPL
 anticipated. 
 Also, although iPhone supply was constrained during the quarter, 
AAPL
 managed to keep sales from dipping, maintaining relatively flat iPhone revs yr/yr at $65.8 bln. Meanwhile, iPad revenue jumped by over 13% yr/yr to $9.4 bln, crushing the consensus, which called for a single-digit decline. 
On the flip side, 
AAPL
 does not expect iPad to continue seeing growth, forecasting a double-digit decline yr/yr in MarQ. 
AAPL
 provided the same outlook for Mac sales. 
 It was also encouraging to hear CEO Tim Cook comment that production is now back to where it should be, especially after several disruptions in China throughout the past few months sparked heightened uncertainty. As a result, 
AAPL
 projects iPhone revs to accelerate sequentially in MarQ. 
Furthermore, if not for foreign exchange impacts, which clipped 800 bps off sales growth in the quarter, 
AAPL
 would have seen positive growth yr/yr and posted growth in most of the markets it tracks. The same story will also play out in MarQ, as 
AAPL
 projects FX headwinds to dent sales growth by 5 pts. 
AAPL
 also reached a milestone in the quarter, boasting over two billion active devices as part of its installed base, double the figure from seven years ago. The significance of this achievement is that it represents a sturdy foundation for future ecosystem expansion. 
AAPL
 tempered expectations heading into Q1, expecting revs to decelerate sequentially and Mac revs to experience a substantial decline due to challenging comps. As a result, although its Q1 report was not exactly crisp, 
AAPL
 delivered relatively decent numbers, especially when stacked against the numerous obstacles it had to endure. It is crystal clear by now that 2023 will be a turbulent year for tech firms with heavy consumer exposure. However, it is hard to bet against 
AAPL
 and its exceptional brand loyalty, especially when the company continues to demonstrate that demand remains sound.

  (148.53 
+3.10
)
Apple (
AAPL
) will report Q1 (Dec) earnings tonight after the close.  There is a conference call scheduled for 17:00 ET. 
Q1 Capital IQ consensus calls for EPS of $1.95 (versus $2.10 last year) on revenue of $121.65 bln (versus -2% yr/yr). The Street is expecting Q1 gross margins of 43.0% versus 43.8% last year. 
This is the first full quarter where the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Pro will be included in its earnings.  On the last conference call, the company expected that revenue growth will decelerate in Q1 (Dec) vs Q4 (Sep).  Mac revenue is expected to decline substantially due to tough comparable from last year. Gross margins are expected to be 42.5-43.5%. There were press reports suggesting that Apple is lowering production of iPhone 14 Plus. It will be interesting to know if this issue extends towards the more expensive Pro models. In addition, any color around the potential timing of new AR/VR headset release will be of interest. 
Investors should not expect a stock buyback announcement similar to what Meta (META) did.  Apple always updates its capital return program in Q2 (Mar).
The company has not provided exact revenue guidance since the pandemic began
. It will be interesting when and if the company starts providing exact guidance again. 
Q2 Capital IQ consensus calls for EPS of $1.47 (versus $1.52 last year) on revenue of $97.03 bln (roughly unchanged yr/yr). The Street is expecting Q2 gross margins of 43.1% versus 43.8% last year.
The Street is expecting Q1 iPhone revenue of $69.0 bln vs. $65.6 bln last year,
 Mac revenue of $9.8 bln vs. $8.7 bln last year, iPad revenue of $7.6 bln vs. $8.3 bln last year, wearables revenue of $15.1 bln vs. $13.0 bln last year, and services revenue of $20.8 bln vs. $15.8 bln last year.
When the company reported Q4 (Sep), CEO Tim Cook quelled fears of waning demand by citing supply issues as the culprit. Still, 
AAPL
 is not immune to the macroeconomic obstacles weakening demand. CFO Luca Maestri pointed out that digital advertising and gaming are areas where the company is experiencing softness. iPhone revs of $42.6 bln, a 10% climb yr/yr, was also a Q4 record. A notable development was exceptional growth in emerging markets, such as India, Vietnam, and Indonesia, which each doubled iPhone sales yr/yr. Although 
AAPL
 has been seeing tremendous growth in emerging markets for some time, we like seeing this continue, especially during an economic downturn, as it highlights the company's ability to translate its marketing prowess and brand power to many different customers and cultures.
AAPL
 has a $2.27 trillion valuation and currently trades at 23 times FY23 earnings.

"28-Dec-22  06:53 ET","AAPL","Apple: Estimated shipments of iPhone 14 devices in 2022 have been lowered to 78.1 million units due to impact of COVID-19 lockdown on Foxconn’s (HNHPF) base in Zhengzhou, says TrendForce
  (130.03)
""The operation of Foxconn's major manufacturing base in the Chinese city of Zhengzhou has been affected by a local COVID-19 outbreak since this October. As a result, the capacity utilization rate of the base has yet to risen above the level of 70%. The outbreak in Zhengzhou was at its worst just as Apple was trying to ramp up sales of the new iPhone models for this year (i.e., the iPhone 14 series) to a peak. Furthermore, the new Pro models have been in high demand, so Apple has kept raising their share in the overall iPhone production. Hence, Foxconn as the sole assembler of the new Pro models has been under significant strain. Besides the Zhengzhou base, Foxconn is also drawing support from its other major base located in the Chinese city of Shenzhen. However, this move still not enough to bring an immediate relief to the current capacity crunch. Given this situation, TrendForce has corrected down its projection on the total shipments of all iPhone 14 models in 2022 to 78.1 million units.""
