Tesla (
TSLA
 -2%)
 hits a speed bump after reportedly slashing prices in China today. The company cut the cost of the Long Range and Performance Model Y by around $1,900 while extending an insurance subsidy for the base Model 3 through the end of September. The price cuts reflect stalling recovery efforts in the region.
 It is not the first time Tesla has trimmed its pricing in China. Last month, Tesla reduced the prices of its Model S and X vehicles in the region by roughly $4,825, following its decision a month earlier to provide cash subsidies to particular Model 3 buyers. Meanwhile, throughout 2022, Tesla was lowering prices across the board, a move that worried investors as it reflected growing competitive risks in the country. 
 Speaking of the competition, Tesla's price cuts today follow in the footsteps of competing China-based electric vehicle (EV) manufacturers. 
Li Auto (LI)
 lowered its average selling price in Q2 to spur more robust delivery growth. 
Nio (NIO) 
reduced prices by over $4,000 despite actively trying to avoid a price war in June. 
XPeng (XPEV)
, which reports Q2 results on Friday, slashed prices of its base models earlier this year to better contend with a challenging demand environment. 
The price war among EV makers in China does not bode well for Tesla -- or its rivals, for that matter -- which is already in hot water regarding the price cuts it announced across many other markets, including the U.S. and Europe, and their negative effect on margins. 
 Last month, shares sunk by 10% on a disappointing Q2 report, headlined by GAAP gross margins tumbling over 680 bps yr/yr to 18.2%. The market was likely anticipating margin stabilization ahead of Tesla's Q2 results. However, even after a significant yr/yr contraction, CEO Elon Musk signaled continual margin pressure over the near term. 
Without Tesla breaking down its deliveries by geography, it is unclear how much the price cuts in China affected the company's record delivery figures in Q2. However, given that its China-based rivals, including XPEV and BYD, as well as other global OEMs, like Volkswagen Group, saw a spike in deliveries during Q2, the cuts likely provided a meaningful boost to Q2 deliveries for Tesla.
  If Mr. Musk's comments last quarter are any indication, stating that he would rather sacrifice margin for volume, price cuts will likely continue as long as global economic conditions remain relatively weak to continue fueling upbeat delivery reports. Adding further evidence, Mr. Musk also noted during the Q2 earnings call that the company adjusts course according to the public's mood. 
As the price war remains active in China, Tesla will struggle to carve out a bottom regarding margins. It helps that commodity costs, including nickel, cobalt, and graphite, have declined across the board, translating to thousands of dollars of positive impact per vehicle. Nevertheless, Tesla shares could have trouble breaking above levels before Q2 earnings until prices, and thus margins, stabilize.

Also, (1) deliveries are guided down q/q for Q3 on temporary production halts; (2) opex is on the rise due to Cybertruck, Dojo and other projects; (3) any step-change in margins will depend predominantly on progress made on the autonomy front, and it would seem overly optimistic to anticipate this for the next 12 months.

Record vehicle deliveries and moderating raw materials prices helped 
Tesla
 (
TSLA
) drive past 2Q23 EPS and revenue expectations, but the EV makers' declining margins, aggressive investment plans, and warning that more price cuts may be on the way have the stock in reverse today.
With shares skyrocketing by about 140% this year, resulting in a steep 1-year forward P/E of around 60x, 
TSLA
 had little room for error. While there are plenty of positives, including a reaffirm of FY23 production of 1.8 mln vehicles, the blemishes are significant enough to elicit a profit-taking pullback.
Heading into the report, a popular narrative was that 
TSLA
's margins were set to stabilize in Q2, setting the stage for meaningful improvements in 2H23. Now, however, that presumption looks premature after 
TSLA
's automotive gross margin slipped to about 18%, while GAAP gross margin dove by 682 bps yr/yr to 18.2%, missing expectations. 
The bigger issue, though, is that Elon Musk signaled that more margin-eroding price cuts could soon be on the way as the EV price war rages on. Compared to a year ago, the average selling price has already fallen by nearly 20%.
After digesting that news, earnings call participants were greeted by Musk's proclamation that 
TSLA
 will spend more than $1.0 bln by the end of 2024 to develop a supercomputer called ""Dojo."" That disclosure isn't sitting too well with investors who are becoming increasingly anxious about 
TSLA
's profitability. 
In typical Musk fashion, the eccentric CEO promised that the investments in Dojo, which is accumulating massive amounts of video data from 
TSLA
 vehicles, will ultimately make the company's current financial metrics ""look silly."" Dojo will be used to power 
TSLA
's full self-driving (FSD) technology and is viewed by Musk as the key to substantially increasing the value of current and future vehicles.
Musk is comfortable with the idea of sacrificing margins for volume since more cars on the road now equates to greater FSD-related revenue down the road. Of course, Musk has over-promised and under-delivered on the development of FSD, so investors are taking his statements with a grain of salt. 
On that note, during the earnings call, he said that he thinks FSD will be better than human driving capability by the end of this year.
Speaking of ""looking silly"", the Cybertruck was another main topic last night, with Musk seemingly walking back the expectation that deliveries will begin in Q1. Instead, he simply stated that the first deliveries are slated for later this year and that production will gradually increase in 2024.
Overall, it's a mixed bag for 
TSLA
 with sales remaining very healthy, but at the expense of margins. Participants wanted to come away from this report with the feeling that margins have bottomed out and are set to improve in 2H, but that didn't happen, resulting in a profit-taking sell-off.

The company achieved record vehicle production and deliveries.
Dojo training computer is designed to significantly reduce the cost of neural net training. Also expects to use Nvidia (NVDA) for training computers.
Tesla has more units on the road collecting AI data
The company continues to target 1.8mm vehicle deliveries this year, although it expects that Q3 production will be a little bit down because of summer shutdowns for a lot of factory upgrades.
The short-term variances in gross margin and profitability really are minor relative to the long-term picture.
When interest rates rise, the company said it has to reduce the price of the car because the interest payments increase the price of the car.
CyberTruck has a lot of new technology in it.

After the close, 
Tesla 
(
TSLA
) is scheduled to report 2Q23 earnings with a conference call set to follow at 5:30 p.m. ET. The electric vehicle maker's earnings report is expected to be posted on the Investor Relations page of its website at about 4:05 p.m., followed soon thereafter by a press release.
The current FactSet consensus estimate stands at EPS of $0.80 and $24.2 bln, reflecting an estimated yr/yr EPS decline of 65% on a 43% increase in revenue.
On July 3, 
TSLA
 reported record Q2 deliveries of 466,140 (+83% yr/yr), exceeding expectations while illustrating that its aggressive price-cutting strategy has amped up demand
. 
Similar to last quarter, 
TSLA
's automotive gross margin (excluding regulatory credits) will be under the spotlight as participants assess the impact of the company's price cuts.
 In Q1, automotive gross margin cratered by five percentage points sequentially to about 16%, while 
TSLA
's overall gross margin of 19% fell well short of estimates.
The general expectation among analysts is that margins will bottom out this quarter before improving in 2H23. With production and volumes ramping up at the Austin, TX and Berlin, Germany factories, manufacturing efficiencies should be improving, providing a boost to automotive gross margins.
The big news this week was that 
TSLA
 built its first Cybertruck at the Austin, TX factory
. During the Q1 earnings call in April, Elon Musk commented that there's a ""tremendous amount of demand"" for Cybertruck, which represents 
TSLA
's first new vehicle launch since it introduced the Model Y SUV in 2020. However, Cybertruck won't move the needle much this year in terms of deliveries and revenue as 
TSLA
 gradually ramps up production. Next year, though, Cybertruck is poised to become a significant growth catalyst.
TSLA
's production guidance, which should be provided in the shareholder deck, will also be closely monitored. Last quarter, the company reaffirmed its expectation to deliver about 1.8 mln vehicles in FY23
, representing impressive yr/yr growth of 31%. Elon Musk upped the ante during the earnings call, though, stating that the company may be able to reach the 2.0 mln mark this year for deliveries.
The stock is red-hot heading into the report, soaring by about 140% on a year-to-date basis. In turn, the stock's valuation has reached sky-high levels with a 1-year forward P/E of around 60x.
 The impressive rally and rich valuation raises the risk of a sell-the-news reaction, but it's also worth keeping in mind that 
TSLA
 hasn't missed EPS expectations since 2Q19. (PVIEW)

  (285.17

Tesla
 (
TSLA
) shares have been supercharged over the past two months, surging by about 75% since mid-May, and now the stock is amped up again after the company announced that the first Cybertruck was built at its Austin, Texas facility. 
Originally planned for production in 2021, the Cybertruck has been both a source of excitement and frustration for investors as delays continually pushed the launch date out. With the finish line finally in sight -- 
TSLA
 is expecting its first deliveries in Q3 -- the long-awaited (and funny-looking) Cybertruck is poised to become its next major growth catalyst.
During the Q2 earnings call in April, Elon Musk commented that there's a ""tremendous amount of demand"" for Cybertruck, which represents 
TSLA
's first new vehicle launch since it introduced the Model Y SUV in 2020. 
However, it will take some time before it becomes a meaningful contributor on the top-line as 
TSLA
 ramps up production. In fact, if 
TSLA
 cracks the 10,000 mark for deliveries this year, that would likely be viewed as a success. For some perspective, the company is targeting total deliveries of approximately 1.8 mln for FY23.
Furthermore, 
TSLA
's automotive gross margin will likely be pressured due to the manufacturing inefficiencies associated with low production rates. Considering that 
TSLA
's margins are already being squeezed from its price-cutting strategy, the prospects of another dip in margins isn't great news. 
Last quarter, automotive gross margin (excluding regulatory credits) cratered by five percentage points sequentially to about 16%. 
CFO Zachary Kirkhorn had previously stated that automotive gross margin should stay above 20% for FY23, but that seems unlikely now -- especially since 
TSLA
 just announced another set of price decreases in China.
Market participants, though, are looking ahead to FY24 when Cybertruck production has fully ramped up and deliveries are moving the needle. The general expectation is that margins should bottom out in 2H23 before rebounding in FY24, setting the stage for strong earnings growth next year. On that note, analysts are currently forecasting EPS to grow by more than 40% in FY24, compared to a projected 16% drop this year.
There are still some key unknowns. 
For instance, the price for Cybertruck has yet to be disclosed. Musk has noted in the past that Cybertruck has some new technology and that its frame is made out stainless steel, making it expensive to produce. In an environment in which 
TSLA
 is frequently cutting prices to drive demand up, we're curious whether a higher-priced EV with an odd design will meet the high delivery expectations that are set for it. 
Earlier this morning, 
Ford Motor
 (
F
) reported that it lowered the price of its F-150 Lightning pickup truck by up to 17% as the EV price war heats up. Combined with the Cybertruck launch news, the price cut disclosure has sent shares of Ford sharply lower. 
Rivian
 (
RIVN
), which makes the R1T pickup truck, is also notably lower on rising competition concerns. 
The bottom line is that the production of the first Cybertruck at the Texas facility marks an important milestone for 
TSLA
 and signals that a new growth catalyst is on the horizon. There may be some more bumps in the road as it relates to 
TSLA
's margins, but market participants seem to be looking beyond those issues and focusing on a return to solid earnings growth in FY24.

On that note, during the earnings call, he said that he thinks FSD will be better than human driving capability by the end of this year.
Speaking of ""looking silly"", the Cybertruck was another main topic last night, with Musk seemingly walking back the expectation that deliveries will begin in Q1. Instead, he simply stated that the first deliveries are slated for later this year and that production will gradually increase in 2024.
Overall, it's a mixed bag for 
TSLA
 with sales remaining very healthy, but at the expense of margins. Participants wanted to come away from this report with the feeling that margins have bottomed out and are set to improve in 2H, but that didn't happen, resulting in a profit-taking sell-off.

The current FactSet consensus estimate stands at EPS of $0.80 and $24.2 bln, reflecting an estimated yr/yr EPS decline of 65% on a 43% increase in revenue.
On July 3, 
TSLA
 reported record Q2 deliveries of 466,140 (+83% yr/yr), exceeding expectations while illustrating that its aggressive price-cutting strategy has amped up demand
. 
Similar to last quarter, 
TSLA
's automotive gross margin (excluding regulatory credits) will be under the spotlight as participants assess the impact of the company's price cuts.
 In Q1, automotive gross margin cratered by five percentage points sequentially to about 16%, while 
TSLA
's overall gross margin of 19% fell well short of estimates.
The general expectation among analysts is that margins will bottom out this quarter before improving in 2H23. With production and volumes ramping up at the Austin, TX and Berlin, Germany factories, manufacturing efficiencies should be improving, providing a boost to automotive gross margins.
The big news this week was that 
TSLA
 built its first Cybertruck at the Austin, TX factory
. During the Q1 earnings call in April, Elon Musk commented that there's a ""tremendous amount of demand"" for Cybertruck, which represents 
TSLA
's first new vehicle launch since it introduced the Model Y SUV in 2020. However, Cybertruck won't move the needle much this year in terms of deliveries and revenue as 
TSLA
 gradually ramps up production. Next year, though, Cybertruck is poised to become a significant growth catalyst.
TSLA
's production guidance, which should be provided in the shareholder deck, will also be closely monitored. Last quarter, the company reaffirmed its expectation to deliver about 1.8 mln vehicles in FY23
, representing impressive yr/yr growth of 31%. Elon Musk upped the ante during the earnings call, though, stating that the company may be able to reach the 2.0 mln mark this year for deliveries.
The stock is red-hot heading into the report, soaring by about 140% on a year-to-date basis. In turn, the stock's valuation has reached sky-high levels with a 1-year forward P/E of around 60x.

  (285.17

Tesla
 (
TSLA
) shares have been supercharged over the past two months, surging by about 75% since mid-May, and now the stock is amped up again after the company announced that the first Cybertruck was built at its Austin, Texas facility. 
Originally planned for production in 2021, the Cybertruck has been both a source of excitement and frustration for investors as delays continually pushed the launch date out. With the finish line finally in sight -- 
TSLA
 is expecting its first deliveries in Q3 -- the long-awaited (and funny-looking) Cybertruck is poised to become its next major growth catalyst.
During the Q2 earnings call in April, Elon Musk commented that there's a ""tremendous amount of demand"" for Cybertruck, which represents 
TSLA
's first new vehicle launch since it introduced the Model Y SUV in 2020. 
However, it will take some time before it becomes a meaningful contributor on the top-line as 
TSLA
 ramps up production. In fact, if 
TSLA
 cracks the 10,000 mark for deliveries this year, that would likely be viewed as a success. For some perspective, the company is targeting total deliveries of approximately 1.8 mln for FY23.
Furthermore, 
TSLA
's automotive gross margin will likely be pressured due to the manufacturing inefficiencies associated with low production rates. Considering that 
TSLA
's margins are already being squeezed from its price-cutting strategy, the prospects of another dip in margins isn't great news. 
Last quarter, automotive gross margin (excluding regulatory credits) cratered by five percentage points sequentially to about 16%. 
CFO Zachary Kirkhorn had previously stated that automotive gross margin should stay above 20% for FY23, but that seems unlikely now -- especially since 
TSLA
 just announced another set of price decreases in China.
Market participants, though, are looking ahead to FY24 when Cybertruck production has fully ramped up and deliveries are moving the needle. The general expectation is that margins should bottom out in 2H23 before rebounding in FY24, setting the stage for strong earnings growth next year. On that note, analysts are currently forecasting EPS to grow by more than 40% in FY24, compared to a projected 16% drop this year.
There are still some key unknowns. 
For instance, the price for Cybertruck has yet to be disclosed. Musk has noted in the past that Cybertruck has some new technology and that its frame is made out stainless steel, making it expensive to produce. In an environment in which 
TSLA
 is frequently cutting prices to drive demand up, we're curious whether a higher-priced EV with an odd design will meet the high delivery expectations that are set for it. 
Earlier this morning, 
Ford Motor
 (
F
) reported that it lowered the price of its F-150 Lightning pickup truck by up to 17% as the EV price war heats up. Combined with the Cybertruck launch news, the price cut disclosure has sent shares of Ford sharply lower. 
Rivian
 (
RIVN
), which makes the R1T pickup truck, is also notably lower on rising competition concerns. 
The bottom line is that the production of the first Cybertruck at the Texas facility marks an important milestone for 
TSLA
 and signals that a new growth catalyst is on the horizon. There may be some more bumps in the road as it relates to 
TSLA
's margins, but market participants seem to be looking beyond those issues and focusing on a return to solid earnings growth in FY24.

  (273.55 
-17.71
)
Record vehicle deliveries and moderating raw materials prices helped 
Tesla
 (
TSLA
) drive past 2Q23 EPS and revenue expectations, but the EV makers' declining margins, aggressive investment plans, and warning that more price cuts may be on the way have the stock in reverse today.
With shares skyrocketing by about 140% this year, resulting in a steep 1-year forward P/E of around 60x, 
TSLA
 had little room for error. While there are plenty of positives, including a reaffirm of FY23 production of 1.8 mln vehicles, the blemishes are significant enough to elicit a profit-taking pullback.
Heading into the report, a popular narrative was that 
TSLA
's margins were set to stabilize in Q2, setting the stage for meaningful improvements in 2H23. Now, however, that presumption looks premature after 
TSLA
's automotive gross margin slipped to about 18%, while GAAP gross margin dove by 682 bps yr/yr to 18.2%, missing expectations. 
The bigger issue, though, is that Elon Musk signaled that more margin-eroding price cuts could soon be on the way as the EV price war rages on. Compared to a year ago, the average selling price has already fallen by nearly 20%.
After digesting that news, earnings call participants were greeted by Musk's proclamation that 
TSLA
 will spend more than $1.0 bln by the end of 2024 to develop a supercomputer called ""Dojo."" That disclosure isn't sitting too well with investors who are becoming increasingly anxious about 
TSLA
's profitability. 
In typical Musk fashion, the eccentric CEO promised that the investments in Dojo, which is accumulating massive amounts of video data from 
TSLA
 vehicles, will ultimately make the company's current financial metrics ""look silly."" Dojo will be used to power 
TSLA
's full self-driving (FSD) technology and is viewed by Musk as the key to substantially increasing the value of current and future vehicles.
Musk is comfortable with the idea of sacrificing margins for volume since more cars on the road now equates to greater FSD-related revenue down the road. Of course, Musk has over-promised and under-delivered on the development of FSD, so investors are taking his statements with a grain of salt.

Ongoing price cuts and U.S. tax credits for electric vehicles (EVs) again offset the broader economic headwinds in Q2, including higher interest rates and sticky inflation, fueling 
Tesla's (
TSLA
 +7%)
 record deliveries in the quarter and energizing the stock. Tesla delivered 466,140 vehicles in Q2, nicely ahead of street estimates and a 10.5% improvement from the previous quarter, which was also a record. 
 Tesla's delivery report may also not be the sole factor sending its shares higher today. Several other EV manufacturers, including 
Rivian (RIVN)
, 
XPeng (XPEV)
, 
NIO (NIO)
, and 
Li Auto (LI)
, each registered solid delivery figures in Q2 and June, a broader reflection of underlying health within the EV industry. The upbeat reports are also lifting other non-pure EV OEMs, such as 
Ford (F)
, 
General Motors (GM)
, and 
Volkswagen (VWAGY)
. 
Tesla divides its deliveries into Model S/X (higher-priced models) and Model 3/Y (lower-priced models). Its lower-priced Model 3/Y group exhibited notable strength, with deliveries up a whopping 87.4% yr/yr and 8.4% sequentially to 446,915. The yr/yr growth showcased the pent-up demand following a lengthy chip shortage that hindered production last year. 
 Meanwhile, Model S/X deliveries were the inverse, climbing 19.0% yr/yr and 79.8% sequentially to 19,225. The massive leap from Q1 is due to January price cuts, which were most significant across the Model S and X lineup, not taking effect until March. Additional reductions in April also saw Tesla's higher-tier lineup receive larger discounts than the Model 3 and Y. 
However, even though the slashed prices helped power higher deliveries, it likely came at the further expense of margins. Last quarter, this worry partly contributed to a notable sell-off. Tesla also did see margin erosion during Q1, with total gross margins contracting by 977 bps yr/yr and 450 bps sequentially to 19.3%, well shy of analyst expectations. 
 Furthermore, a disparity between production (479,700) and deliveries (466,140) remained relatively wide in Q2. When production continues to exceed deliveries, it signals rising inventories, a reflection of potential demand weakness. However, the discrepancy continued to narrow over the past three quarters on an absolute and percentage basis. Additionally, management remarked last quarter that the production/delivery difference resulted from the company moving to a more-regional balanced mix of build and deliveries.
  Tesla's recent price cuts to qualify its vehicle lineup for the new U.S. tax credits have sparked a significant rally in deliveries over the past two quarters. Unlike after its Q1 report, investors applaud Tesla's numbers from Q2, a reflection of dissipating worries that China-based competitors are stealing market share and macroeconomic conditions are eroding demand. 
 Although margins will likely undergo another quarter of contraction in Q2 (scheduled for July 19), Tesla's actions have spurred considerable demand. They may also accelerate its long-term goal of reaching 20 mln in annual deliveries. With Tesla's charging technology quickly becoming the U.S. standard following deals with Ford and GM and its long-awaited Cybertruck slated for launch this year, the company is showing no signs of letting off the throttle despite its shares already surging over 140% YTD.

  (252.09 
+17.23
)
The good news keeps pouring in for 
Tesla
 (
TSLA
), which is trading at its highest levels since early October of last year, with the stock receiving yet another boost  courtesy of 
General Motors
 (
GM
). About two weeks after rival 
Ford Motor
 (
F
) reached an agreement with 
TSLA
 that provides its EV customers with access to Tesla Superchargers, GM announced a similar deal with 
TSLA
 last night. Specifically, the partnership will allow GM's EV drivers to use 12,000 Tesla Superchargers across North America starting in 2024 in a move that market participants are viewing as a win-win situation.
For 
TSLA
, the benefit of these agreements with GM and Ford is two-fold.
First, and most importantly, providing GM and Ford access to its Superchargers will likely give it an insurmountable lead in the race to establish an industry standard for charging. Currently, there are two primary charging systems in the market: the North American Charging Standard (NACS) design that 
TSLA
 has adopted, and the Combined Charging System (CCS) used by GM, Ford, and other EV makers.
Initially, GM customers will need to use an adapter to access 
TSLA
's Supercharger stations, but beginning in 2025, the company's EVs will be built with a NACS inlet, removing the need for an adapter. 
With GM and Ford switching over to the NACS connector design, 
TSLA
's charging network will significantly expand while likely ultimately becoming the single standard. A more robust charging network across the country will make 
TSLA
's vehicles even more marketable, reducing customers' concerns about inadequate charging options on the roadways.
Second, 
TSLA
 will generate substantially more revenue from its Supercharger stations. In 3Q23, Services and Other Revenue, which includes paid Supercharging fees, increased by 44% to $1.8 bln. 
Although the Services and Other category only represented about 8% of 
TSLA
's total revenue in Q3, that percentage should increase as GM and Ford EV customers begin accessing its charging stations. 
For some context, GM has said that it will have the capacity to build 1.0 mln EVs in North America by 2025, while Ford is targeting a 2.0 mln EV run rate by 2026.
From GM's perspective, the upside of partnering with 
TSLA
 is that it will instantly and significantly expand the charging network for its customers, without having to invest in the buildout of its own system. CEO Mary Barra commented that collaborating with 
TSLA
 ""knocks down a possible barrier to car buyers, some of whom worry about adequate charging"" on the roads.
The main takeaway is that this agreement with GM is another big win for 
TSLA
, amplifying a bullish sentiment that has defined the stock over the past month. Earlier this week, it was reported that all trims of the company's Model 3 sedan now officially qualify for the full $7,500 tax credit, following a report from 
Electrek
 on May 25 that 
TSLA
's Model Y became the world's best-selling car. Looking further down the road, the upcoming launch of the Cybertruck later this summer could represent the next catalyst for

"20-Apr-23  10:26 ET","TSLA","Tesla's aggressive price cutting strategy puts major dent in margins, sending stock in reverse
  (167.02 
-13.57
)
The million-dollar question heading into 
Tesla's
 (
TSLA
) 1Q23 earnings report was whether the electric vehicle maker's margins would at least meet expectations following a series of price cuts in the U.S. and China.
Last night, investors didn't receive the answer they were looking for as automotive gross margin (excluding regulatory credits) cratered by five percentage points sequentially to about 16%, while 
TSLA
's overall gross margin of 19% fell well short of estimates. 
Some may recall that CFO Zachary Kirkhorn stated that FY23 automotive gross margin should stay above 20% for FY23, but a steep drop in ASPs this quarter pushed the metric below that floor level.
Despite the plunge in gross margin, 
TSLA
 still managed to meet EPS estimates. 
However, 
TSLA
's profitability and cash flow on a yr/yr basis is heading in reverse. Specifically, net income and free cash flow tumbled by 22% and 80%, respectively. Making matters worse for the stock, CEO Elon Musk signaled during the earnings call that more price cuts could be on the horizon, stating that he intends to continue leveraging the company's position as a cost leader.
Essentially, Musk is creating a price war in the EV market -- whether he wants to admit it or not -- in order to protect/gain market share and grow volumes, at the expense of profits. This isn't a positive development for other EV makers, especially for up-and-coming companies like 
Rivian 
(
RIVN
) or 
Lucid Group
 (
LCID
) that are already being squeezed by manufacturing inefficiencies due to low production volumes.
It's also not a positive for 
TSLA
 -- at least, not in the short-term. The stock is not cheap, trading with a Forward P/E of nearly 50x. With the ""E"" component of that valuation metric set to decline, the ""P"" component will have to follow suit in order to avoid a valuation that truly reaches nose-bleed levels.
On the positive side, 
TSLA
 did reaffirm its expectation to deliver about 1.8 mln vehicles in FY23, representing impressive yr/yr growth of 31%. 
In fact, just like last quarter, Musk said that the company may be able to reach the 2 mln mark this year for deliveries. Even as Musk predicts more ""stormy weather"" for the economy this year, he expects that demand will hold up quite well.
Additionally, Mr. Kirkhorn noted that cost reductions and improved efficiency at its new factories should support improved margins later this year. Whether those factors are enough to fully offset the price cuts and drive automotive gross margin back above 20% remains to be seen, but at least the trend for improved production efficiency is accelerating.
The main takeaway is that 
TSLA
's aggressive price cutting strategy is having a worse-than-feared impact on its margins and profits, which is a bad recipe for an expensive stock. From a longer-term perspective, the company's strategy to drive volume higher and extend its lead in the EV market will probably pay dividends, but it's going to be bumpy ride for investors as its profits dwindle.

  (180.59)
The company reduced prices considerably in early Q1, but its operating margin remains among the best in the industry. The company is under the view that pushing for higher volumes and a larger fleet is the right choice here versus a lower volume and higher margin. The company expects its vehicles, over time, will be able to generate significant profit through autonomy.
Regarding the Cybertruck, the company continues to build Alpha versions of the Cybertruck and the company is anticipating having delivery event in Q3.

  (181.46 
-2.85
)
After the close, leading electric vehicle maker 
Tesla 
(
TSLA
) is scheduled to report 1Q23 earnings with a conference call set to follow at 5:30 p.m. E.T. The company's earnings report is expected to be posted on the Investor Relations page of its website at about 4:05 p.m., followed soon thereafter by a press release.
For the quarter, 
TSLA
 is expected to post EPS and revenue of $0.85 and $23.36 bln, respectively. On a yr/yr basis, an inline quarter would equate to a yr/yr EPS decline of 74%, on a revenue increase of 24.5%.
The main story revolving around 
TSLA
 over the past several months has been its steady stream of price cuts and the anticipated impact on automotive gross margin from those price cuts. Just last night, the company once again lowered its prices, this time reducing the price on each version of its Model Y SUV by $3,000 and cutting the cost on the base Model 3 by nearly 5%.
This round of cuts marks the sixth time that 
TSLA
 has reduced prices over the past year. Recall that in January, the company slashed U.S. prices by as much as 20% on the Model Y and Model 3 vehicles in order to qualify those vehicles for tax credits under the Inflation Reduction Act.
Prior to the U.S. price cuts, 
TSLA
 looked to spark demand in China by lowering prices for all versions of its Model 3 and Model Y cars in October, and then again in January.
From a demand perspective, the pricing strategy has been a clear success. When 
TSLA
 reported Q4 earnings in late January, CEO Elon Musk stated that January had so far seen the strongest orders on a year-to-date basis in the company's history, and that orders are coming in at almost twice the rate of production.
Fast forward to April 3, and 
TSLA
 reported a new quarterly record for deliveries, which increased by 36% yr/yr to 422,875, slightly topping analysts' estimates. Model 3 and Model Y were especially strong with combined deliveries of 412,180, up 40% yr/yr, illustrating the positive impact from the price cuts.
The big question heading into this earnings report, though, is how severe of an impact those price cuts have had on 
TSLA
's automotive gross margin
. Last quarter, automotive gross margin dipped by 466 bps yr/yr to 25.9% -- even as ASPs were up on a yr/yr basis -- as the launch of new plants in Austin, TX and Berlin, Germany weighed on margins. Most of the price cuts didn't take hold until Q1, so the yr/yr decline in automotive gross margin could be pretty jarring tonight.
CFO Zachary Kirkhorn has stated that FY23 automotive gross margin should remain above 20% with average selling prices in the high $40K range.
 Therefore, if automotive gross margin comes in comfortably ahead of that 20% mark, that could be a positive catalyst for the stock.
TSLA
's annual production guidance will be another closely monitored item. In the Q4 earnings report, the company guided for production of 1.8 mln vehicles this year, equating to yr/yr growth of about 37%.
 However, Musk revealed that internal projections are targeting production closer to 2.0 mln vehicles and that he wanted to remain conservative with the published guidance due to uncertainties regarding the supply chain and economy. Should 
TSLA
 produce 2.0 mln vehicles this year, that would equate to yr/yr growth of 46%.
Finally, 
TSLA
's recent history of outperforming analysts' expectations is encouraging. On that note, the company has exceeded EPS and revenue estimates in seven of the past eight quarters,

"26-Jan-23  10:16 ET","TSLA","Tesla's price cuts putting a charge into January orders, easing widespread demand concerns
  (158.04 
+13.61
)
The intensifying demand concerns that sent shares of 
Tesla
 (
TSLA
) spiraling lower in 2022 are fading into the rearview mirror following the EV maker's encouraging 4Q22 earnings report. 
TSLA
 beat analysts' EPS estimates, despite a 446 bps contraction in automotive gross margin, but the main story centers on a surge in orders that were sparked by the company's recent price cuts.
During last night's earnings call, Elon Musk stated that January has so far seen the strongest orders on a year-to-date basis in 
TSLA
's history, and that orders are coming in at almost twice the rate of production.
Simply put, the price cuts have been far more effective than many had imagined, validating 
TSLA
's strategy to sacrifice margins in the near-term for volume and market share. 
A key aspect of the price cuts is that they made most of 
TSLA
's models eligible for the $7,500 tax credit under the Inflation Reduction Act. When combined with the price discount, the tax incentive lowered the overall price by over 20% on some models. That's a meaningful decrease that expands 
TSLA
's potential customer base. 
While Musk's gloomy macroeconomic outlook hasn't changed, with the eccentric CEO predicting a painful recession this year, he still expects 2023 to be a strong year for 
TSLA
. 
Officially, the company guided for production of 1.8 mln vehicles this year, equating to yr/yr growth of about 37%. However, Musk revealed that internal projections are targeting production closer to 2.0 mln vehicles and that he wanted to remain conservative with the published guidance due to uncertainties regarding the supply chain and economy. Should 
TSLA
 produce 2.0 mln vehicles this year, that would equate to yr/yr growth of 46%. 
Of course, Musk's mission to bring Tesla EVs to the masses will come at a cost: namely, lower margins and profits. We saw this play out in Q4 as operating margin slipped by 120 bps sequentially to 16.0%. 
Looking ahead, more margin compression is likely, but the impact is perhaps not as severe as investors had anticipated. CFO Zachary Krikhorn soothed those worries by stating that FY23 automotive gross margin should remain above 20%.
Further down the road, the next major growth catalyst is set to unfold in FY24 when the oft-delayed Cybertruck will finally begin mass production at the Austin, TX plant. By that time, it's also possible that margins could be experiencing some relief from lower commodity prices due to slower economic growth. 
There are still plenty of challenges confronting 
TSLA
, including rising competition in China from up-and-coming manufacturers like 
BYD Co
. (
BYDDY
) and 
NIO
 (
NIO
), but the Q4 earnings beat and bullish commentary suggest that fears about slumping demand were mostly overblown.

  (144.43)
The company said thus far in January it has seen the strongest orders YTD in its history. The company is currently seeing orders at almost twice the rate of production.
 They raised the price of the Model Y because of this.
Prices changes will make a difference for the average consumer. The company expects there will be an impact on operating margin in the near term. However, it believes margins will remain healthy.
The company expects FY23 automotive gross margins to above 20% and average selling price to be $47K.
The company said its intentional production potential is closer to 2 million vehicles versus 1.8 mln FY23 delivery guidance.
CEO Elon Musk expects there will be ""bumps along the way"" and that there will be a ""pretty difficult recession this year.""

"25-Jan-23  16:54 ET","TSLA","Tesla: Color on earnings -- EV maker able to drive past reduced expectations, but company alters its outlook language
  (144.43

TSLA
 shares were running higher heading into this report, rallying by nearly 30% since early January. As it became clearer that demand was softening in Q4 -- as evidenced by 
TSLA
's production stoppage in Shanghai, and its price cuts in the U.S. and China -- EPS estimates came tumbling lower. 
TSLA
 was able to edge past those deflated estimates, but we wonder if that will be enough to keep this upward momentum going.
As anticipated, automotive gross margin took a pretty big hit, sliding lower by 466 bps yr/yr to 25.9%. While 
TSLA
 reported that ASPs were up on a yr/yr basis, they almost certainly were lower on a qtr/qtr basis. 
The company adjusted its guidance, which could be throwing some investors off. The past few quarters, 
TSLA
 has said that it expects to achieve 50% average annual growth in vehicle deliveries over a multi-year horizon. Today, the company said its growing production in alignment with the 50% CAGR target it previously guided to, adding that it some years it may grow faster and some slower. For 2023, 
TSLA
 says it ""expects to remain ahead of the long-term CAGR with around 1.8 mln cars for the year."" If 
TSLA
 delivers 1.8 mln cars in FY23, that would pencil out to yr/yr growth of 37%, which is obviously below that 50% figure.

"25-Jan-23  12:38 ET","TSLA","Tesla earnings preview -- Demand front and center after EV maker ramps up price cuts
  (143.13 
-0.71
)
After the close, 
Tesla 
(
TSLA
) is scheduled to report 4Q22 earnings with a conference call set for 5:30 p.m. ET. The electric vehicle maker's earnings report is expected to be posted on the Investor Relations page of its website at about 4:05 p.m., followed soon thereafter by a press release.
Current estimates for 
TSLA
 call for the company to report EPS and revenue of $1.11 and $24.3 bln, respectively. An inline quarter would represent a 56% yr/yr decrease in EPS and a 37% jump in revenue.
TSLA
 crashed in 2022 with shares plunging by ~65%. December was especially rough for 
TSLA
 as demand concerns intensified as the EV maker began slashing prices in China and the U.S. Additionally, the EV maker halted all production at its Shanghai facility on December 24, according to
 Reuters
. As the news became more worrisome, estimates for 
TSLA
's Q4 Production and Delivery report skidded lower, putting more downward pressure on the stock.
It turned out that Q4 delivery estimates were still too high as 
TSLA
's deliveries of 405,000 missed the mark. Similar to Q3, 
TSLA
 produced far more cars than it delivered -- 439,000 vs. 405,000 -- adding to investors' angst. However, 
TSLA
 explained that the variance is not demand related, but rather, is due to its transition towards a more even regional mix of vehicle builds to contend with the increasing difficulty of securing vehicle transportation at a reasonable cost.
Once the calendar flipped to 2023, the stock executed a sharp U-turn and is currently higher by about 16% year-to-date. That rebound could put the stock in a precarious position if 
TSLA
 falls short of estimates that have been reduced in recent weeks. 
With 
TSLA
 ramping up discounts, the obvious risk is that a dip in ASPs will accelerate its automotive gross margin erosion. That concern was amplified when the 
Wall Street Journal
 reported on January 13 that 
TSLA
 cut prices in the U.S. by as much as 20% on some vehicles. Last quarter, automotive gross margin declined by 260 bps yr/yr to 27.9%, partly due to the ramp up of production at 
TSLA
's Austin, TX and Berlin, Germany plants. Those two plants don't benefit from the same economies of scale that 
TSLA
's Shanghai and Fremont, CA plants do, resulting in much lower margins.
Plenty of attention will be given to 
TSLA
's outlook. The company has stuck with its guidance of ""achieving 50% average annual growth in vehicle deliveries over a multi-year horizon"", but it didn't meet that target in 2022 as deliveries grew by 40% to 1.31 mln. For Musk and Company, the hope is that its aggressive price cut strategy will translate into a major upswing in sales and deliveries. There's some early evidence that this strategy is paying dividends with 
Electrek
 reporting on January 17 that 
TSLA
 is experiencing record demand in response to its price cuts.
Despite the macroeconomic uncertainties, 
TSLA
 isn't taking its foot off the accelerator in terms of expanding its capacity. The company recently confirmed that it will invest over $3.6 bln to expand Gigafactory Nevada, which will house production of its Semi truck. Additionally, 
Bloomberg
 reported on January 11 that 
TSLA
 is nearing a deal to construct a facility in Indonesia.
Lastly, 
TSLA
 still has a rich valuation with a forward P/E of about 28x, but that is down substantially from last September when the stock was trading with a forward P/E of 45x. (PVIEW)

  (112.83

)
Shares of 
Tesla (
TSLA
 -8%)
 are pulling back today following the EV maker's Q4 Delivery and Production report. Growth was substantial, with 
TSLA
's total vehicle production jumping 44% yr/yr to 439,701 while deliveries climbed 31% to 405,278. However, 
TSLA
's record deliveries still missed analyst expectations, its third consecutive miss. It also does not help that analysts trimmed their estimates in the weeks leading to 
TSLA
's report. 
Meanwhile, the gap between production and deliveries grew wider sequentially in Q4, keeping demand concerns in the spotlight. However, the gap remains related to 
TSLA
's transition towards a more even regional mix of vehicle builds to contend with the increasing difficulty of securing vehicle transportation at a reasonable cost. 
 This was set in motion last quarter, resulting in an uptick in cars in transit at the end of Q3. The same held true in Q4; 
TSLA
 commented that its ongoing transition again led to a further increase in vehicles in transit at the end of the quarter. 
 Still, in China, competition is heating up as 
TSLA
's Chinese competitors, 
NIO (NIO)
, 
Li Auto (LI)
, and 
Xpeng (XPEV)
, are all punching it today after posting upbeat delivery data. NIO and LI each grew deliveries by over 50% yr/yr during December, while XPEV's deliveries surged 94% from the prior month in December. 
 The silver lining is that demand remains robust even as China faces a spike in COVID-19 cases. However, with China comprising just under a third of 
TSLA
's total revs in FY21, fiercer competition in the region adds another obstacle to 
TSLA
's growing list of headwinds. 
This list of headwinds, including rising interest rates, pronounced inflation, and an energy crisis in Europe, will likely make for a bumpy ride in FY23. As a result, 
TSLA
's Q4 deliveries miss was not what the company needed to be added to its plate. Although deliveries set another record, the miss adds further speculation that the demand landscape is souring. The news that 
TSLA
 shut down production at its Shanghai plant just over a week ago, the company reportedly doubling its discount on select vehicles, and CEO Elon Musk's engagement with Twitter only adds to this concern. 
 Bottom line, 
TSLA
 is starting off the new year in the wrong gear, keeping its shares stuck in a downward trend. The stock fell roughly 70% in 2022, tumbling by 60% over just the past three months. However, with the new EV tax credits kicking in and Mr. Musk noting he would abide by the results of a recent Twitter poll and step down as CEO, perhaps investors will buy today's news, helping 
TSLA
 to begin turning a corner.

  (210.41 
-11.63
)
For the first time since 2Q19, 
Tesla
 (
TSLA
) fell short of analysts' earnings and revenue expectations in 3Q22, feeding into concerns that demand is wavering under escalating macroeconomic pressures. 
TSLA
's eccentric CEO, Elon Musk, sent mixed messages about the demand environment during the earnings conference call, stating that he expects an ""epic end of the year"" and that the company will sell every car it produces in Q4.
However, Musk acknowledged that ""demand is a little harder than it would otherwise be"" as the Federal Reserve raises interest rates more than it should, in his opinion. He also said that Europe and China are experiencing different types of recessions, with the former getting hit hard by soaring energy prices, and the latter dealing with plunging property prices.
TSLA
's actual results and outlook, though, don't depict a company that's struggling to find customers.
While 
TSLA
 did slightly miss Q3 estimates, revenue grew by a robust 56% yr/yr to $21.45 bln, marking a new quarterly sales record. Meanwhile, operating margin expanded by more than 260 bps yr/yr to 17.2%, despite the rising costs associated with the ramp up of 
TSLA
's Berlin, Germany and Austin, TX plants. The strong top-line growth, coupled with the margin expansion, drove a 75% yr/yr increase in non-GAAP net income to $3.65 bln.
Each of 
TSLA
's factories produced a record number of vehicles in Q3. Since the end of Q2, Berlin has doubled its weekly output to 2,000 from 1,000 vehicles with the Austin factory not far behind. Automotive gross margin still decreased by nearly 260 bps yr/yr to 27.9%, but the metric was flat on a sequential basis. Considering that the prior quarter's ASP benefitted from lower production at Shanghai (due to COVID lockdowns), the flat qtr/qtr performance looks pretty solid.
TSLA
 maintained its outlook of achieving 50% average annual growth in vehicle deliveries over a multi-year horizon, although CFO Zachary Kirkhorn cautioned that deliveries this year may not meet that growth target. According to Kirkhorn, the issue isn't demand related -- rather, it's due to transportation and logistics constraints.
Recall that when 
TSLA
 reported Q3 production and delivery results on October 3, there was a large discrepancy between production (365K) and deliveries (343K). This difference was caused by challenges in loading huge batches of vehicles onto ships and trains during a timeframe of just a few days. For some context, roughly one-third of Q3 deliveries occurred in the final two weeks of September, with many of those vehicles still in transit when 
TSLA
 issued its production and delivery report.
This issue is expected to play out again in Q4, creating another gap between production and deliveries. 
TSLA
 is working to remedy this situation by smoothing out regional builds throughout the quarter, which should reduce its peak needs for outbound logistics.
Overall, it was a solid quarter for 
TSLA
, but the stock's rich valuation with a forward P/E of ~37x leaves little room for error, especially since the company's demand picture is under such intense scrutiny. Musk tried to ease those valuation concerns last night by predicting that 
TSLA
 will someday be worth more than 
Apple
 (
AAPL
) and Saudi Aramco combined. Based on today's stock action, it's clear that investors are taking that declaration with a huge grain of salt.

  (220.04 
-0.15
)
After today's close, 
Tesla
 (
TSLA
) is scheduled to report 3Q22 results with a conference call following at 5:30 p.m. E.T. The electric vehicle (EV) maker's earnings report is expected to be posted on the Investor Relations page of its website at about 4:05 p.m., followed soon thereafter by a press release.
For the quarter,
 analysts are forecasting 
TSLA
 to report EPS and revenue of $1.08 and $21.9 bln, respectively. After announcing that it delivered a quarterly record of 343,000 vehicles in Q3 (+42% yr/yr) on October 3, 
TSLA
 is poised to report record quarterly revenue as well.
However, 
that delivery number still missed analysts' expectations and trailed the production number of 365,000 by a fairly wide margin. This discrepancy between production and deliveries has created some demand concerns, especially since lead times for new vehicles has been shortening
. 
TSLA
 explained that it's becoming more difficult to secure vehicle transportation at reasonable costs as its production volume grows. As a result, there were more cars in transit at the end of Q3, presumably causing the difference between production and deliveries.
Even prior to the Q3 Production and Delivery report, concerns were growing that rising interest rates and macroeconomic uncertainty would put a dent in demand. 
Despite these headwinds and the persistent supply constraints, 
TSLA
 hasn't backed off its delivery guidance yet. Last quarter, it reiterated that it expects to achieve 50% average annual growth in vehicle deliveries over a multi-year horizon. During the Q2 earnings conference call, Elon Musk commented that the company has the potential for a record-breaking second half of the year.
The company will indeed need an incredible finish to the year to meet its 50% delivery growth target. Specifically, 
TSLA
 will need to deliver nearly 500K vehicles in Q4, representing a sequential increase of 42%
. Even if Musk reaffirms the annual delivery growth guidance, there is bound to be some skepticism that 
TSLA
 will ultimately attain that forecast.
The good news is that production capacity continues to ramp higher as 
TSLA
's new Berlin, Germany and Austin, TX plants increase their output. Last quarter, 
TSLA
 disclosed that Berlin was churning out 1,000 vehicles per week, which should be even higher now. As production increases, manufacturing efficiencies improve, pushing 
TSLA
's automotive gross margin higher.
COVID-related lockdowns in China last quarter caused production and revenue to decline materially on a sequential basis. Consequently, automotive gross margin slipped by 46 bps yr/yr to 27.9%.
 Price increases, a sharp acceleration in production, and some easing of supply chain disruptions should translate into a rebound for automotive gross margin in Q3
.
TSLA
 has been weak heading into the report, down nearly 30% since mid-September. Some of the weakness is attributable to the demand/delivery concerns, but the drama surrounding Musk and his acquisition of 
Twitter 
(
TWTR
) has also weighed on the stock. Musk has already sold about $15 bln in 
TSLA
 shares this year to help finance the deal. Although Musk recently stated that he's likely done selling 
TSLA
 stock, it's not out of the question that another round of selling will be needed if he can't secure enough outside capital to complete the TWTR deal.
Lastly, 
TSLA
 has officially rolled out its Semi Truck with deliveries to 
Pepsi
 (
PEP
) slated for December 1. Commentary regarding demand and ordering trends will be of particular interest during the call. Additionally, participants will be listening for any updates on the Cybertruck pickup, which is expected to launch next year after being delayed by a couple years. (PVIEW)

Colorado, Connecticut, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, New Mexico, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia, and Washington, have adopted California's ZEV and LEV regulations, and two additional states, Pennsylvania and Delaware, have adopted California's LEV regulations and are considering adopting California's ZEV regulation, which, when combined with California, account for about 40 percent of both the population or people and new light-duty vehicle sales in the United States.""

  (785.03 
+42.53
)
Tesla's
 (
TSLA
) revenue and automotive gross margin declined significantly on a sequential basis in 2Q22, ending a string of increases for both key metrics over the past several quarters. While the electric vehicle maker easily surpassed EPS expectations as operating expenses also fell on a qtr/qtr basis, its free cash flow of $621 mln came up short of analysts' estimates. Despite these blemishes, the initial reaction to 
TSLA
's earnings report has been positive for a few reasons.
Due to the COVID-related lockdowns in China and the associated shutdown of 
TSLA
's Shanghai facility, a rough quarter was anticipated and baked into the stock. Since early April, shares have plunged by 35%, setting up a rebound on results that are better-than-feared. Ahead of the print, there was some concern that 
TSLA
 would post a free cash flow number that was much closer to breakeven.
More importantly, 
TSLA
 maintained its delivery guidance, stating that it still expects to achieve 50% average annual growth in vehicle deliveries over a multi-year horizon. During the earnings conference call, Elon Musk commented that the company has the potential for a record-breaking second half of the year.
To reach that 50% growth target this year, the company will need to produce about 1.4 mln vehicles in 2022.
So far in 2022, 
TSLA
 has produced approximately 564K vehicles. Therefore, the company will need to make an average of 418K vehicles in Q3 and Q4 to achieve its goal. To put this into perspective, 
TSLA
's highest quarterly production number was 305,840 in 4Q21.
It may seem unrealistic for 
TSLA
 to ramp up production that substantially, especially since the company is going through ""supply chain hell"", as Musk put it. However, the new Berlin factory is becoming a major factor, churning out 1,000 vehicles per week. Additionally, the Shanghai plant was upgraded earlier this month and it is now capable of ramping its weekly production higher by roughly 5,000 vehicles to 22,000 vehicles per week.
Musk offered an optimistic view on inflation and the supply chain, stating that costs may come down later this year. He even suggested that 
TSLA
 may reduce car prices after the company lifted prices several times recently to offset inflationary pressures. An easing of raw material costs in 2H22 could coincide with improving manufacturing efficiencies at its new Berlin and Austin factories, enabling automotive gross margin to reverse higher.
It was a difficult quarter, as reflected in the 10% sequential drop in revenue and the 500 bps contraction in automotive gross margin from Q1. In fact, the quarter was so turbulent that Musk decided to sell 75% of the company's Bitcoin holdings to shore up the balance sheet. This quarter, though, is now in the rearview mirror and a more bullish sentiment is brewing as 
TSLA
 is poised to ramp up production in a major way. There are still macroeconomic risks and uncertainties that can stymie 
TSLA
's momentum, though, including the threat of future lockdowns in China if virus cases increase again.

  (746.38 
+9.79
)
After the close, 
Tesla
 (
TSLA
) is scheduled to report Q2 results with a conference call scheduled for 5:30 p.m. ET. The electric vehicle maker's results should be made available on the Investor Relations page of its website at about 4:05 p.m.
For the quarter, analysts are expecting 
TSLA
 to report EPS and revenue of $1.81 and $16.9 bln, respectively. An inline quarter for sales would equate to a decline of about 10% on a sequential basis. This drop-off, though, is widely-anticipated
 and is partly responsible for the stock's 35% plunge since early April. COVID-related lockdowns in China forced 
TSLA
 to shut down its Shanghai factory for a good portion of the quarter.
The impact of those shutdowns was evident when 
TSLA
 reported Q2 deliveries on July 5. Specifically, deliveries slipped by 18% sequentially to 254,695 vehicles, representing the first qtr/qtr decline in deliveries in two years.
The metric that may best illustrate the difficulties for 
TSLA
 in Q2 is free cash flow. Analysts are forecasting free cash flow of about $900 mln, representing a 60% plunge from Q1.
 While lower deliveries will make a significant dent in cash flow generation, the company is also burning plenty of cash on its new factories in Berlin and Austin. Recall that on June 22, Elon Musk quipped that the two new factories were ""money furnaces"" that were losing billions of dollars.
A sequential decline in automotive gross margin also wouldn't be surprising given that the Berlin and Austin factories are now operational. Those plants will be far less efficient than the Shanghai factory until production is much higher. 
Last quarter, automotive gross margin expanded by 636 bps to 32.9% as a combination of manufacturing efficiencies, price increases, and a favorable mix towards the higher-priced Model Y provided a boost. 
On June 16, 
TSLA
 pushed through another round of price increases across its entire vehicle lineup, but that action was likely too late in the quarter to have much of an effect on Q2 results.
Beyond the rough fundamental picture in Q2, Elon Musk's back-and-forth drama with 
Twitter 
(
TWTR
) has also weighed on 
TSLA
 shares. With TWTR filing a lawsuit against Musk to force him to make good on his $54.20/share bid to buy the company, concerns remain that Musk may need to unload more 
TSLA
 shares to finance the acquisition. 
Since we believe that a rough quarter is already fully anticipated and priced in to the stock, we expect that TWTR's annual delivery growth guidance will be the key that drives the stock action
. 
Last quarter, CFO Zach Kirkhorn reiterated the company's expectation to achieve 50% average annual growth in vehicle deliveries over a multi-year horizon.
At that time, Musk accurately forecasted that Q2 production would be lower than Q1, but he added that Q3 and Q4 should be substantially higher. That prediction may also come to fruition as June 2022 was the highest vehicle production month in 
TSLA
's history.
That momentum temporarily ceased during the first two weeks of July as 
TSLA
 suspended most production at its Shanghai plant to conduct factory upgrades. However, once completed, the Shanghai facility will be capable of ramping its weekly production higher by about 5,000 vehicles to 22,000 vehicles per week.
Lastly, investors and analysts will be interested in hearing about any production updates for Cybertruck, which is currently slated for production out of the Austin facility next year. (PVIEW)

  (1057.33 
+80.13
)
To borrow a phrase that Elon Musk used during last night's earnings conference call, 
Tesla
 (
TSLA
) pulled a rabbit out of the hat in 1Q22 to post strong, upside results in the face of a production suspension, supply chain issues, and fierce inflationary pressures. A six-day shutdown of its Shanghai factory in late March acted as little more than a speed bump as deliveries surged by 68% yr/yr to 310,048. Demand was already red hot before fuel prices rocketed higher this year, but now interest in owning a Tesla is at a fever pitch.
Consequently, 
TSLA
 was able to raise prices in Q1, enabling it to mitigate the impact of a ""multiple fold"" jump in raw material costs. The company didn't disclose the increase in average selling prices (ASP), but it was probably significant, since automotive gross margin surged by 636 bps yr/yr to 32.9%. A positive mix shift toward the higher-priced Model Y also helped. Manufacturing efficiencies are the other main factor in 
TSLA
's impressive margin performance. Its ability to maintain such a high level of execution in this turbulent environment is a testament to 
TSLA
's workforce, which has become a major competitive advantage.
Whether that exceptional workforce can continue to defy the odds in Q2 and 2H22 was another primary concern heading into the print. With production in Shanghai just restarting this week on a limited basis, Q2 is off to a rough start. It could be several weeks before the plant is operating at full capacity. 
Adding to the complexity is Musk's interest in acquiring
 Twitter
 (
TWTR
). Many worry that his attention will be divided during an incredibly challenging time for 
TSLA
, which could result in a drop-off in performance. His presence on the earnings conference call was reassuring, especially since he offered some very encouraging commentary.
After CFO Zach Kirkhorn stated that 
TSLA
's delivery growth target of 50% or above remains attainable for this year, Musk one-upped him by commenting that a 60% yr/yr increase is possible. He conceded that Q2 production could be slightly lower than Q1 but added that Q3 and Q4 should be substantially higher.
Musk reiterated that volume production for Cybertruck is expected next year. That vehicle will be made at the newly opened facility in Austin, Texas, which is currently ramping production of the Model Y. While cautioning that it takes time for a new plant to reach high production volumes, he expects the Texas factory to churn out 5,000 vehicles per week in 9-12 months' time.
From a longer-term perspective, Musk highlighted the Optimus robot program, commenting that it will ultimately be larger than 
TSLA
's electric vehicle business. The robot, which is currently slated to be launched next year, will allegedly be able to perform redundant human tasks, including those conducted in a factory setting.
Given the state of chip shortages and vast supply chain issues, however, we are quite skeptical that 
TSLA
 will scale production of Optimus in a meaningful way over the coming twelve months.
One concern we do have is that automotive gross margin could slide a bit as the new Texas and Germany factories begin ramping production at higher volumes. Overall, though, it's hard not to be impressed by 
TSLA
's execution and remarkable ability to overcome steep obstacles.

)
After the close, 
Tesla
 (
TSLA
)
 is scheduled to report 1Q22 results with a conference call set to follow at 5:30 p.m. E.T. The EV maker's results were released at 4:09 E.T. last quarter and were made available on the Investor Relations page of its website. 
For the quarter, analysts are expecting 
TSLA
 to report EPS and revenue of $2.27 and $17.8 bln, respectively. 
TSLA
 doesn't offer formal EPS or revenue guidance, but, it does provide a forecast for annual vehicle delivery growth over a multi-year horizon. 
Last quarter, the company reaffirmed its expectation to achieve 50% average annual growth in vehicle deliveries over a multi-year horizon.
TSLA
 has topped analysts' EPS and revenue expectations in each of the past four quarters, but operating conditions have become even more treacherous over the past several weeks. In late March, the company's Shanghai factory suspended production due to lockdown measures associated with China's ""zero COVID"" policy. 
Since the shutdown occurred late in the quarter, the impact won't be overly severe for Q1. On that note, 
TSLA
 reported that Q1 deliveries jumped by 68% to 310,048 on April 4, just missing the consensus estimate. The result was heralded as a win given that supply chain disruptions have intensified due to the government-imposed lockdowns.
The more pressing concern is that 
TSLA
 could provide a more cautious outlook for deliveries in Q2 and/or for FY22. Reports have surfaced that production restarted in Shanghai this week -- albeit, with strict limitations -- offering some hope that manufacturing activities will normalize soon.
Taking some of the sting out of Shanghai's production suspension is news that the Berlin factory officially opened on March 22. Eventually, the plant will be capable of producing 500K vehicles annually, but it will take time for 
TSLA
 to ramp up to that level. Additionally, the lower production rate means that manufacturing efficiencies will lag 
TSLA
's Fremont and Shanghai factories.
Therefore, automotive gross margin, which has been a source of strength for 
TSLA
, could slip a bit in 2H22. Last quarter, automotive gross margin jumped by 648 bps yr/yr to 30.6%.
Amid these headwinds, CEO Elon Musk has set his sights on acquiring 
Twitter 
(
TWTR
), offering to purchase the social media company for $54.20/share on April 14. Naturally, there's some concern that Musk's focus on TWTR will create a significant distraction that hinders 
TSLA
's execution. Notably, shares of 
TSLA
 have slid by about 15% since Musk's equity stake in TWTR was first revealed on April 4.
Supply chain issues have caused 
TSLA
 to delay its Cybertruck and semi truck launches. On April 8, the company held an event to open its Austin, TX factory, where the Cybertruck and semi will eventually be produced. During the event, Musk stated that production for both vehicles will begin next year. Of course, the timeline could be pushed back further if supply chain disruptions haven't eased by then. (PVIEW)

  (869.98 
-67.43
)
Staying true to recent form, 
Tesla
 (
TSLA
) overcame supply chain constraints to exceed EPS and revenue expectations for the fourth consecutive quarter in its 4Q21 results. 
TSLA
's ingenuity has enabled it to embed chips and other parts from new suppliers, while growing enthusiasm for electric vehicles (EVs) in general continues to provide a strong tailwind. The inflection point for the EV market that CEO Elon Musk described during 
TSLA
's 2Q21 earnings conference call in July has clearly been reached. In addition to 
TSLA
's impressive 4Q21 results, the EV market's breakout has been highlighted recently by the insatiable demand for 
Ford Motor's
 (
F
) all-electric F-150 Lightning pickup and upstart 
Rivian's
 (
RIVN
) plans to sharply increase production to meet demand.
Bullish trends in the EV market tell only part of the story. After recording many years of unprofitability, 
TSLA
 is now a well-oiled machine with significant earnings power, thanks to steady improvements in manufacturing efficiency and economies of scale. These gains are best expressed in 
TSLA
's automotive gross margin, which expanded by 648 bps yr/yr to 30.6%. It's unlikely that 
TSLA
 will maintain that level of margin improvement in FY22 as it opens new factories in Austin, TX and Berlin, Germany. However, as 
TSLA
 is delaying its launches of Cybertruck, Semi, and a $25,000 car, those new factories may initially focus on producing Model 3s and Ys -- a process that the company has already mastered.
Pushing out the new EV launches didn't change 
TSLA
's outlook of achieving 50% average annual growth in vehicle deliveries over a multi-year horizon. In fact, Musk expects FY22 delivery growth to exceed 50%. Despite the upbeat guidance, the stock is stuck in reverse today due to the following items:
There's concern that the launch delays will cause 
TSLA
 to lose ground in a fiercely competitive market. Ford, 
General Motors
 (
GM
), and RIVN have all-electric pickup trucks on the market this year, creating fear that 
TSLA
's Cybertruck will fall behind.
Musk believes that launching new vehicles when the company is already parts-constrained doesn't make sense. That's a sensible view, but the constant moving of the goal posts is a source of frustration.
Relatedly, Musk's grandiose plan for 
TSLA
 to have fully self-driving cars by the end of 2022 isn't resonating well with investors. Considering the substantial issues that 
TSLA
's autopilot technology has encountered --  including its role in a dozen crashes that spurred an investigation by the NHTSA -- launching a truly self-driving EV this year seems like a stretch.
The bottom line from the two points above is that the growth story for FY22 lost some luster in the eyes of investors. With a P/S in the 25x neighborhood, the stock has little wiggle room if growth expectations change.
The main takeaway is that 
TSLA
 continues to operate at a high level in a very challenging environment as EV demand remains red-hot, but its plans to delay new vehicle launches remove a key FY22 growth catalyst.

Automotive gross margin up 648 bps yr/yr to 30.6%.
Energy storage deployments increased by 32% YoY in 2021, mainly driven by strong Megapack deployments. As demand remains substantially above capacity, growth has been limited by supply.
Solar deployments were 345 MW in 2021, increasing by 68% YoY, with cash/loan purchases accounting for nearly all solar deployments. Solar Roof deployments nearly tripled YoY in 2021 and continued to grow sequentially in Q4.
""We aim to increase our production as quickly as we can, not only through ramping production at new factories in Austin and Berlin, but also by maximizing output from our established factories in Fremont and Shanghai.

Outlook
: ""We plan to grow our manufacturing capacity as quickly as possible. Over a multi-year horizon, we expect to achieve 50% average annual growth in vehicle deliveries. The rate of growth will depend on our equipment capacity, operational efficiency and the capacity and stability of the supply chain.

  (926.01 
+7.61
)
After the close, electric vehicle (EV) leader 
Tesla
 (
TSLA
) is scheduled to report 4Q21 results with a conference call to follow at 5:30 p.m. ET. The company's quarterly results are typically released at about 4:05 p.m. E.T.
For the quarter, 
TSLA
 is expected to report EPS and revenue of $2.37 and $16.6 bln, respectively. 
TSLA
 doesn't provide specific EPS and revenue guidance, but it does typically offer its outlook for average annual growth in vehicle deliveries. 
In the Q3 earnings release, 
TSLA
 stated, ""... Over a multi-year horizon, we expect to achieve 50% average annual growth in vehicle deliveries. The rate of growth will depend on our equipment capacity, operational efficiency and the capacity and stability of the supply chain.""
On January 3, 
TSLA
 reported very strong Q4 delivery numbers that smashed analysts' expectations. Specifically, total deliveries surged by 71% yr/yr to 308,000 vehicles, with Model 3 and Model Y leading the way. On a combined basis, 
TSLA
 delivered nearly 297,000 of those two vehicles, up 83% from a year earlier.
The impressive delivery results illustrated, once again, that 
TSLA
 has navigated around most of the supply chain issues and chip shortages that have plagued other auto OEMs. A key to the company's success has been its ability to develop new firmware to assimilate with chips made by new suppliers.
It's clear that demand remains very strong and it seems likely that automotive gross margins also held up well due to 
TSLA
's improving manufacturing efficiencies. Last quarter, automotive gross margin increased 281 bps yr/yr to 30.5%, despite a 6% decline in ASPs.
However, investors should brace for automotive gross margin to slip later this year once 
TSLA
's new factories in Austin, TX and Berlin, Germany are operational.
Beyond the financial results and outlook, 
TSLA
's commentary and timeline regarding the Cybertruck launch will be of interest. Recall that on January 14, the company pushed out Cybertruck production to 2023 from 2022. Originally, the company expected to launch Cybertruck in late 2021.
TSLA
 has easily surpassed top and bottom line estimates in each of the past three quarters. On the expectation that 
TSLA
 will keep that streak alive, the stock has been in rally mode this week, up about 5%. (PVIEW)

  (930.35 
+30.41
)
Tesla (
TSLA
 930.35, +30.41, +3.4%) was not acting well this morning. It started on a positive note, but almost just as quickly was met with renewed selling interest -- much like it has been most days since hitting an all-time high of 1201.95 on November 22.
At today's low (886.12), 
TSLA
 was down 26.3% from its all-time high. That slide was precipitated by news that Elon Musk was selling a bunch of stock to help pay taxes and, presumably, diversify some of his holdings. It was also precipitated by worries that the Fed's shift to a tighter monetary policy would invite higher interest rates and multiple compression for highly-valued growth stocks. 
One can probably also attribute the sizable decline to weak-handed holders, who had chased the stock in its phenomenal October run, bailing out as the stock's momentum moved away from them.
Today, however, the stock is showing some rebound fight. There wasn't a news catalyst that prompted the reversal off this morning's low. It was a sentiment shift. That is, there was a concerted belief that the stock had been oversold on a short-term basis and was ripe for a rebound. At its low today, 
TSLA
 was down 10.9% from its high last Thursday (less than three, full trading sessions).
TSLA
 has work to do to prove that this rebound is more than a one-day wonder. It's still well below its 50-day moving average (1028), and we would add that this rebound effort isn't being accompanied by extremely heavy volume. Roughly 19.3 mln shares have traded versus average volume of approximately 26.2 mln shares.

 "
"21-Oct-21  10:45 ET","TSLA","Tesla speeds past supply chain roadblocks to deliver another impressive quarterly report
  (898.70 
+32.90
)
Already contending with semiconductor shortages and severe shipping disruptions, rolling blackouts due to an energy crisis in China added another major hurdle for 
Tesla
 (
TSLA
) in 3Q21. Incredibly, the electric vehicle (EV) maker continued to steer around most of these roadblocks, delivering yet another strong, upside earnings report that featured a 73% surge in deliveries. As impressive as the delivery growth is, the performance would have been even better had 
TSLA
 been able to run its factories at full capacity throughout the quarter.
While demand remains robust, 
TSLA
's operational efficiency also continues to improve, pushing its automotive gross margin higher by 281 bps yr/yr to 30.5%. The company achieved this despite experiencing a 6% yr/yr drop in average selling prices, while commodity costs also increased. A key factor behind 
TSLA
's rising margins is the ramp up of production at its Shanghai factory. During the earnings conference call, CFO Zack Kirkhorn explained that 
TSLA
's bottom line ""continues to benefit from the marginal profitability of each incremental unit with higher fixed cost absorption.""
Looking ahead, Kirkhorn warned that the company's margins could take a hit, though, after it opens its factories in Austin, TX and Germany. These new plants, which are slated to begin production late this year, will take some time to reach the efficiency levels achieved at 
TSLA
's California and Shanghai factories. Adding to the complexity, these plants will be rolling out completely new models -- including the Cybertruck in Austin -- that are built by new manufacturing technologies. 
On the topic of Cybertruck, CEO Elon Musk stated that production should start by the end of next year, with volume production anticipated in 2023. That timeline represents a significant push-back from the prior forecast of initial production starting by the end of 2021. Given the current status of the supply chain, and 
TSLA
's prioritization of launching the new Model Y, the delay isn't surprising.
TSLA
 doesn't see the supply chain and chip shortage situation improving any time soon. In fact, Musk commented that the supply chain shortages could persist until 2023. Still, the company reiterated its outlook of achieving 50% average annual growth in vehicle deliveries over a multi-year horizon. In the near-term, 
TSLA
 plans to squeeze out production from its existing facilities, although it is struggling to keep up with demand. Backlogs are continuing to grow, and average customer wait times are extending.
Overall, 
TSLA
 is executing remarkably well in an extremely challenging environment. It won't get much easier for the company moving forward as 
General Motors
 (
GM
), 
Ford Motor
 (
F
), and others prepare to launch a barrage of new EVs in the coming years. However, as its Q3 results illustrate, 
TSLA
 has a proven track record of overcoming challenges and exceeding expectations.

"20-Oct-21  14:14 ET","TSLA","Tesla earnings preview - Shares are amped up heading into report as investors shrug off chip shortage concerns
  (866.83 
+2.55
)
After the close, 
Tesla
 (
TSLA
) is scheduled to report Q3 results with a conference call set to follow at 5:30 p.m. ET. 
TSLA
's earnings reports typically show up on the Investor Relations page of its website prior to the press release. Last quarter, its earnings were available there at about 4:05 ET.
For the quarter, analysts are expecting the electric vehicle maker to report EPS and revenue of $1.61 and $13.7 bln, respectively. On a yr/yr basis, an inline quarter would equate to EPS and revenue growth of 112% and 56%, respectively.
The stock has been on fire heading into the report, up ~18% since early September, and are threatening to hit record highs. This surge clearly raises the stakes for 
TSLA
, making an impressive report necessary to keep the upward momentum going.
Chip shortages and supply chain disruptions remain a prime concern for 
TSLA
 and every other auto manufacturer. However, 
TSLA
 has managed to navigate around these issues better than most, thanks in part to its strategy to substitute semiconductors that are in short supply with alternative chips, and then rewrite the firmware to maintain production.
Relatedly, 
TSLA
's production has remained remarkably strong, as illustrated in its record deliveries for Q3. Recall that on October 3, the company reported that Q3 vehicle deliveries soared by more than 70% yr/yr to 241,300 units. Meanwhile, 
General Motors
 (
GM
) and 
Ford Motor
 (
F
) have reported sharp yr/yr decreases in deliveries as the companies idle plants due to chip shortages.
The impressive Q3 deliveries report takes some of the mystery out of 
TSLA
's earnings report. Demand certainly remained strong during the quarter. The main question, therefore, is whether automotive gross margin continued to improve. Last quarter, this key metric came in at 28.4%, up 313 bps yr/yr, despite a 3% yr/yr decline in ASPs. The increase in automotive gross margin was driven by improved production efficiencies.
Beyond the Q3 results, a focal point for investors will be on 
TSLA
's outlook. In the Q2 report, CEO Elon Musk reiterated the expectation for 
TSLA
 to achieve 50% average annual growth in vehicle deliveries over a multi-year horizon. He added that, in some years, 
TSLA
 may grow faster, which is expected to be the case in 2021.
Lastly, any commentary regarding the Cybertruck production timeline will be of interest. 
TSLA
 recently pushed back the launch until late 2022, after formerly projecting a late 2021 launch.

  (641.40

In 2Q21, 
Tesla
 (
TSLA
) overcame lingering semiconductor shortages to deliver exceptional results that featured record quarterly operating profit of $1.3 bln and a sharp increase in automotive gross margin to 28.4%. The company's improving production efficiency and cost optimization efforts were key factors behind the strong performance, leading to the sizable $0.47 EPS beat. Additionally, 
TSLA
's ingenuity enabled it to mitigate the semiconductor shortages by substituting alternative chips and then rewriting the firmware to maintain production. Consequently, the company achieved record deliveries of 201,304 vehicles during the quarter.
However, 
TSLA
 is not completely immune to supply chain constraints. During the earnings conference call, CEO Elon Musk stated, ""[W]hile we're making cars at full speed, the global chip shortage situation remains quite serious. For the rest of this year, our growth rates will be determined by the slowest part in our supply chain, which is the wide range of chips...""
Therefore, the main question moving forward is whether 
TSLA
 can substantially meet rising consumer demand. On a related note, Musk also noted that consumer support and interest for electric vehicles (EVs) is reaching an inflection point. With momentum steadily building, the challenge will be to keep production running near full capacity in the face of these chip shortages.
Another potential concern for investors is that vehicle ASPs continue to decline. In Q2, ASPs decreased by 2% yr/yr due to lower Model S and Model X deliveries and an unfavorable product mix as China-made vehicles became a larger portion of total sales. We're not overly concerned about the drop, though, because the company is aiming to improve affordability in order to drive volumes upward. In turn, the higher volume creates production efficiencies due to increased scale, pushing automotive gross margin higher.
More worrisome is that 
TSLA
 is delaying the launch of its Semi truck program to 2022 and that it may also shift the launch of its highly-anticipated Cybertruck. Earlier this year, Musk said that initial deliveries of Tesla Semi would start later in 2021. In regards to Cybertruck, the pick-up will be built in 
TSLA
's new Austin, TX facility, which is expected to produce vehicles this year. Since the newly designed Model Y crossover will take precedence in Austin, it's unclear exactly when Cybertrucks will begin rolling out of the plant, especially given the chip shortage situation.
Supply chain issues notwithstanding, the longer-term outlook for 
TSLA
 remains very bright. The company reiterated its forecast to achieve 50% average annual growth in vehicle deliveries over a multi-year horizon. Along with burgeoning demand for EVs, 
TSLA
's rapidly growing energy storage (+204% in MWh deployed) and solar (+215% in MW deployed) businesses provide additional catalysts. While the risks are also considerable, 
TSLA
 has proven that it can still execute in very challenging environments.

After the close, 
Tesla
 (
TSLA
) is scheduled to report Q2 results with a conference call to follow at 5:30 ET. Last quarter, its earnings were available on the Investor Relations page of 
TSLA
's website at about 4:05 E.T.
For the quarter, analysts are forecasting the electric vehicle maker to report EPS and revenue of $0.98 and $11.4 bln, respectively, equating to yr/yr sales growth of 89%.
On July 2, 
TSLA
 reported strong Q2 deliveries of 201,250, reaching a new quarterly record in the process, while achieving impressive yr/yr growth of 121%.
TSLA
 has exceeded top and bottom-line estimates in six of the past seven quarters, with 4Q20 being the exception. After crushing EPS estimates during the 3Q19-2Q20 timeframe, 
TSLA
's earnings beats have significantly moderated of late. Last quarter, the company surpassed EPS estimates by $0.20, which pales in comparison to the $2.34 beat in 2Q20 or the $1.45 beat in 1Q20.
Shares have been in rally mode heading into the print, up ~17% since mid-May. However, the stock remains well below the record highs around the $900 mark seen in late January.
Other than the revenue and EPS headline numbers, a key metric to keep an eye on is automotive gross margin. Last quarter, 
TSLA
 reported automotive gross margin of 26.5% vs. 25.5% in the year ago period and 24.1% in Q4. While the ASPs of its vehicles declined in Q1, auto gross margin increased sequentially, as costs decreased even faster.
Another factor to monitor is regulatory credits, which 
TSLA
 sells to other automakers. The company has augmented its results by selling a significant amount of these credits, taking some of the luster off of its results. In Q1, sales of regulatory credits jumped by 46% yr/yr to $518 mln.
Lastly, investors will be honing in on 
TSLA
's guidance. Last quarter, 
TSLA
 said that over a multi-year horizon, it expects to achieve 50% average annual growth in vehicle deliveries. In some years 
TSLA

  (629.04)
The report states the Model S P100D car was equipped with ""Autopilot"" -- Tesla's advanced driver assistance system. This system requires both the Traffic Aware Cruise Control and the Autosteer systems to be engaged. NTSB tests of an exemplar car at the crash location showed that Traffic Aware Cruise Control could be engaged, but Autosteer was not available on the part of the road (Hammock Dunes Place) where the crash happened.
According to the report the crash trip began at the owner's residence. Footage from the owner's home security cameras show the owner entering the driver's seat and the passenger entering the front passenger seat. The video also shows the car slowly entering the roadway and then accelerating down the road away from the camera and out of sight. Based on examination of the accident scene investigators have determined the car traveled about 550 feet before departing the road on a curve, driving over the curb, and hitting a drainage culvert, a raised manhole and a tree.

"27-Apr-21  10:49 ET","TSLA","Tesla overcomes chip shortage to deliver upside results, but a look under the hood reveals some issues
  (706.03 
-32.17
)
Facing a severe chip shortage that has forced major automakers like 
General Motors
 (
GM
) and 
Ford
 (
F
) to idle assembly lines, 
Tesla
 (
TSLA
) delivered 1Q21 results that easily surpassed analysts' top and bottom-line estimates. Thanks to some shrewd maneuvering, including the quick development of new firmware to assimilate with chips made by new suppliers, 
TSLA
 successfully navigated around the supply chain disruptions to generate a 76% surge in production to 180,338 electric vehicles (EVs). In turn, revenue jumped by 74% to $10.39 bln vs. the $9.89 bln expectation.
TSLA
 has also become more efficient at building EVs. The construction of new factories, which have greatly increased 
TSLA
's scale, and the launch of new products have helped lower the average cost per vehicle. With average selling prices declining by 13% this quarter following an 11% dip in Q4, the enhanced efficiency is vital to the company's improved profitability. For the quarter, automotive gross margin increased by 95 bps yr/yr to 26.5%, bolstering the 304% surge in EPS to $0.93 vs. the $0.73 consensus estimate.
The upside EPS and revenue figures don't tell the whole story, though. A closer look at 
TSLA
's financials reveal that the company's earnings were significantly boosted by two items that aren't core to its operating activities. 
Similar to prior quarters, the company sold a substantial amount of regulatory credits to other auto makers. By exceeding emissions and fuel economy standards, 
TSLA
 earns government tax credits that can be sold to its competitors. During Q1, sales of regulatory credits jumped by 46% yr/yr to $518 mln. A major concern is that 
TSLA
 may not be able to rely as heavily on these sales in the future as other auto makers ramp up EV production numbers.
Additionally, 
TSLA
 partially cashed in on its high-profile $1.5 bln purchase of Bitcoin during Q1. With the leading cryptocurrency doubling in value in Q1, 
TSLA
 took some profits off the table by unloading ~10% of its holding. In turn, the company registered a $100 mln gain, goosing the bottom-line in the process.
Another issue that may be keeping a lid on shares is that 
TSLA
 didn't offer a more specific forecast for FY21 deliveries. The company simply stated that it expects 50% annual growth in deliveries over a multi-year horizon but that it also anticipates stronger growth in some years, including in FY21. With deliveries up 109% in Q1, it's a near certainty that 
TSLA
 will comfortably exceed the 50% growth benchmark this year. The issue, though, is that the ongoing chip shortage problem may hold 
TSLA
 back from reaching its full growth potential. Last night, CEO Elon Musk commented that he expects the shortages to continue to impact the company in Q2 and Q3. This statement may have some wondering whether the workarounds that 
TSLA
 implemented in Q1 will lose some effect moving forward.
There are several moving pieces that are driving the company's financial results, including the company's rapid expansion in the energy storage and residential solar panel businesses. No longer an afterthought, these segments are starting to move the needle in a more pronounced way, as energy storage deployments grew by 71% yr/yr and as solar roof deployments grew by 9x yr/yr. 
The bottom line is that 
TSLA
 executed well in a very challenging environment and that its growth prospects remain bright due to the rising popularity of EVs and its burgeoning energy-related businesses. While its performance wasn't quite as strong as the headline numbers suggest, we believe that some profit-taking is also in play today following the stock's ~20% gain since late March.

Adj. EBITDA of $1.8 bln vs. $951 mln year ago.
Energy storage deployments grew 71% yr/yr in Q1, mainly driven by the popularity of Powerwall. Demand for Powerwall continues to far exceed our production rate. As a result, we recently shifted Powerwall deliveries to solar customers only.
Solar deployments reached 92 MW in Q1, 
TSLA
's strongest quarter in 2.5 years. Solar Roof deployments grew 9x compared to the same period last year.
First deliveries of the new Model S should start very shortly, Model Y production rate in Shanghai continues to improve quickly and two new factories Berlin and Texas are making progress.
TSLA
 is currently building Model Y capacity at Gigafactory Berlin and Gigafactory Texas and remains on track to start production and deliveries from each location in 2021. Gigafactory Shanghai will continue to expand further over time. Tesla Semi deliveries will also begin in 2021.
Over a multi-year horizon, 
TSLA
 expects to achieve 50% average annual growth in vehicle deliveries. In some years 
TSLA
 may grow faster, which it expects to be the case in 2021.

"26-Apr-21  12:42 ET","TSLA","Tesla earnings preview - With strong EV deliveries anticipated, automotive gross margin becomes the key metric
  (738.78 
+9.38
)
After the close, electric vehicle (EV) maker 
Tesla
 (
TSLA
) is scheduled to report 1Q21 earnings with a conference call scheduled for 5:30 p.m. ET. After plunging lower by as much as 40% from record highs in February and early March, the stock is once again in rally mode ahead of its quarterly report.
Per usual, solid top-line growth is anticipated with analysts forecasting revenue to jump by 33% yr/yr to $9.9 bln. 
TSLA
 has exceeded sales expectations for five straight quarters and its robust production and delivery performance in March suggests that another sales beat may be in store.
Specifically, the company reported that EV deliveries soared by over 100% yr/yr to 184,800, easily beating the 177,000 consensus estimate. An impressive showing for the recently launched Model Y in China helped mitigate the effects of the global chip shortage, while the updated Model S and Model X versions also delivered solid results.
While healthy EV demand is all but assured for Q1, the bigger question is whether automotive gross margin remained firm in an enivonrment that's becoming increasingly competitive. Recall that last quarter, automotive gross margin slipped to 20.7% from 23.7% in Q4 as average transaction prices decreased by 11% yr/yr. The more promotional pricing was a significant factor in 
TSLA
's $0.23 EPS miss last quarter. To avoid missing analysts' $0.73 estimate this quarter, a more constructive approach to pricing will be needed.
Although EV's still account for ~86% of 
TSLA
's total revenue, the company's other energy-related businesses are becoming a larger part of the overall story. In fact, 
TSLA
's escalating growth opportunities in its energy storage and solar businesses were an integral factor behind a notable analyst upgrade on April 12. Specifically, Canaccord Genuity analyst Jed Dorsheimer upgraded the stock to Buy and boosted his price target to $1,071, sparking a two-day 13% jump in the stock.
There is ample reason to feel optimistic about 
TSLA
's opportunities in these markets. In Q4, its energy storage deployments grew substantially as battery placements increased by 83% yr/yr to surpass 3 GWh for the first time in a single year. This growth was mainly driven by building momentum for 
TSLA
's Megapack, which is a large-scale battery storage system used by utility companies to store energy that's generated by solar and wind sources. Additionally, 
TSLA
 is experiencing strong demand for its Powerwall products due to rising sales in the residential business, a home battery that can store energy from solar panels or from the grid.
TSLA
 is also taking aim at the residential solar panel business. In 2020, 
TSLA
's solar deployments grew by 18% to 205 MW and the company is expanding its installation team to buoy its growth.
The accelerating momentum in the energy segments have the potential to move the stock, as does the company's update on its FY21 delivery growth guidance. During last quarter's earnings conference call, Musk was somewhat coy about his expectations for FY21 delivery growth, stating that he anticipates an increase of more than 50%. Following the 100%+ surge in March deliveries, this forecast is looking very conservative.
Market participants will also be tuning into the earnings call for any updates on 
TSLA
's development progress for its Semi truck, which should roll out of its new Austin, TX plant late this year. And, lastly, 
TSLA
'a autonomous driving technology will be a focal point following a recent deadly crash in Texas involving a Model S. 
TSLA
 CEO Elon Musk has claimed that the vehicle's autopilot wasn't enable, but an investigation is ongoing with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration looking into whether the vehicle's advanced driver-assistance features were to blame for the crash. This crash represents just one of more than two dozen investigations that the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has opened in regards to 
TSLA
 and its driver-assistance systems.

  (838.82 
-25.24
)
Few companies invoke more debate among investors than 
Tesla
 (
TSLA
) and its eccentric CEO Elon Musk. Therefore, it seems fitting that the company's 4Q20 results provided fodder for both 
TSLA
 bulls and bears. Fans of the EV maker and its stock will point to the company's strong 45% sales increase, which obliterates the growth of most auto manufacturers, and the company's aggressive capacity expansion plans. 
On the flip side, skeptics may argue that 
TSLA
 relied on sharp price cuts to achieve that growth, driving automotive margins lower and making its stock look even more overpriced. For the record, 
TSLA
 is currently trading with a steep forward P/S of ~13.5x.
With 
TSLA
 missing analysts' EPS estimates ($0.80 vs. $1.03), shares are trading lower today, providing bears with a rare win following the stock's astronomical 690% run higher from this time last year. The question moving forward is, does 
TSLA
's earnings disappointment change the narrative in a substantive way, or, is the miss merely a minor bump in the road.
Based on the relatively limited losses in the stock today, we'd argue that investors aren't sweating the miss too much. For a stock that's seemingly ""priced to perfection"", the moderate drop does seem like a head-scratcher. After all, 
TSLA
's automotive gross margin, excluding regulatory credits, slipped to 20.7% from 23.7% last quarter as average transaction prices decreased by 11% yr/yr. Furthermore, this drop in average selling prices comes at a time when many automakers are pushing prices higher due to strong demand. 
General Motors
 (
GM
), for instance, reported in early January that average transaction prices in Q4 reached a company record of $41,886.
Cutting prices in order to sustain market share isn't a positive development, especially since the EV market is becoming increasingly competitive. 
What investors are hanging their hats on, though, is that 
TSLA
 still has a long runway for growth and that it's heavily investing in its expansion plans. During the quarter, 
TSLA
 sunk $1.15 bln into capital expenditures as it upgrades its Fremont, California plant and builds out its Shanghai, Berlin, and Austin, Texas plants.
This year, the company will launch a new and improved version of the Model S, in addition to beginning deliveries of its Model Y crossover in China. Due to the investments made at its factories, 
TSLA
 has increased production capacity by about 100K vehicles at its Fremont and Shanghai facilities. 
This increased production capacity will support healthy vehicle delivery growth. During the earnings conference call last night, Musk was somewhat coy about his expectations for FY21 delivery growth, stating that he anticipates an increase of more than 50%. This outlook translates into deliveries north of 750K vehicles, but many believe Musk is attempting to manage expectations with this rather ambiguous forecast.  When 
TSLA
 released its Q4 delivery numbers on January 4, Musk stated that he believes the company can deliver 840K to 1.0 mln vehicles this year. 
Beyond this year, investors are eyeing a major catalyst in FY22 when 
TSLA
 launches its Cybertruck pickup, which will be produced at the new Austin plant. 
To conclude, doubters of 
TSLA
 may feel like they're in a ""tails you win, heads I lose"" scenario with the stock. After a few quarters of a heightened focus on 
TSLA
's improved profitability, the narrative has suddenly shifted back to 
TSLA
's future growth prospects after the company missed on the bottom-line. Regardless, 
TSLA
's growth potential is indeed compelling as the upgrades, expansions, and opening of plants positions the company to substantially boost production and launch new vehicles.

  (879.88

After the close, newly-minted S&P 500 component 
Tesla
 (
TSLA
) is scheduled to report 4Q20 results with an earrings conference call to follow at 6:30 p.m. ET. With shares up a meteoric 690% yr/yr, the electric car maker faces dauntingly high expectations. Elon Musk and company does have a recent track record of surpassing even the most bullish of predictions, generating strong growth even in the face of a global pandemic. Furthermore, market participants are already aware that demand remained robust in Q4 since 
TSLA
 disclosed that total vehicle deliveries climbed 36% yr/yr to 180,570 on January 4.
That production and delivery report should take most of the mystery out of 
TSLA
's top-line performance. As it currently stands, analysts are expecting the company to generate revenue of $10.4 bln, equating to projected yr/yr growth of 41%. A combination of rising sales in China and production capacity increases are two key factors behind 
TSLA
's double-digit growth.
The Chinese government has prioritized the development of EVs and has offered EV ownership incentives. The country aims to have EVs represent 25% of all vehicles on the road by 2025. For a reference point, only 5% of total cars in 2019 were EVs.
While competition is fierce and is only growing stronger, 
TSLA
 remains very popular in China. Last year, the Model 3 was the best selling EV in China with sales of 138,000 vehicles.
TSLA
 is aggressively expanding its manufacturing capabilities. Not only did the company ramp up its main Fremont, CA facility to increase production by ~100K units, but it's also building out factories in China, Berlin, and Texas.
The Shanghai facility, which can currently produce ~150K Model 3s per year, will see a sharp boost this year following the launch of its Model Y compact crossover. In fact, last Monday, 
TSLA
 delivered its first China-made Model Y.
With the addition of the Model Y, the Shanghai plant is expected to manufacture ~250K vehicles per year, with a long-term goal of reaching 500K units.
Both the Berlin and Austin, TX facilities are slated to open this year. The polarizing Cybertruck pickup, which is scheduled to being production later this year, will be housed at the Austin facility. 
More uncertain is how profitable 
TSLA
 was in Q4. The company has been on a bottom-line role, posting five straight profitable quarters while blowing out EPS estimates in four of those quarters. The lone exception was last quarter when the company beat estimates by a more modest $0.16/share. 
Although ASPs slipped last quarter, adjusted automotive gross margin still improved to 23.7% from 18.7% in Q2. Efficiencies of scale driven by higher production rates and reduced manufacturing and operational costs underpinned the lift in margins.
TSLA
's profitability progress has been widely heralded and was the key factor behind its inclusion in the S&P 500. However, the performance isn't quite as spectacular as it may seem because the company has significantly benefited from accelerating sales of regulatory credits to other auto OEMs. Last quarter, regulatory credits surged by 196% yr/yr to $397 mln, skewing its overall financial performance. It will be interesting to see if this phenomenon played out again in Q4.
Beyond 
TSLA
's Q4 profitability, the other item that could impact the stock is the company's delivery guidance for FY21. When 
TSLA
 released its Q4 delivery numbers, Musk stated that he believes the company can deliver 840K to 1.0 mln vehicles this year. In order to avoid a major letdown, Musk will need to at least reaffirm that forecast tonight.

  (426.25 
+3.61
)
Tesla
 (
TSLA
), which came out of the pandemic relatively unscathed, continued its impressive streak of upside quarterly reports after the close yesterday. Since the electric vehicle maker had already disclosed Q3 deliveries of 139,593 (+44% yr/yr) on October 2, the primary focus yesterday was on whether 
TSLA
 would report its fifth straight profitable quarter.
The company didn't disappoint, posting EPS of $0.76 vs. the $0.60 consensus estimate as Non-GAAP net income soared by 156% yr/yr to $874 mln.
Demand has never been a major issue for 
TSLA
, but some have questioned whether the company can earn enough profit from each car to generate consistent earnings. 
The improvement in automotive gross margin (including regulatory credits), which climbed sharply higher to 23.7% from 18.7% last quarter, helps ease those concerns.
TSLA
 achieved the higher margins despite a slight decline in vehicle average selling price due to a mix shift towards its lower-priced Model 3 and Model Y cars. 
Efficiencies of scale driven by higher production rates and reduced manufacturing and operational costs underpin the lift in margins.
While the enhanced margins and the 39% jump in revenue to $8.77 bln are key elements behind the upside report, a much larger than expected gain in regulatory credits puts the quality of the beat into question.
For the quarter, regulatory credits surged by 196% yr/yr to $397 mln, stronger than the company anticipated. 
TSLA
 sells credits to other vehicle manufacturers that need them to comply with carbon-emissions standards. 
While 
TSLA
 is able to reinvest this revenue into plant expansion plans, the substantial increase in credit sales skews its financial performance.
This issue isn't garnering too much attention, though, because CEO Elon Musk also reiterated the company's very ambitious target to deliver 500,000 vehicles this year. 
This reaffirm of delivery guidance comes as a surprise, given that 
TSLA
 would have to deliver over 180K vehicles in Q4 to meet that target. 
For some perspective, that would equate to yr/yr growth of 60% compared to 44% growth this quarter.
Additionally, Musk commented that next year, deliveries could come in between 840K and 1.0 mln units. 
To meet the forecasted increase in deliveries, 
TSLA
 is ramping up capacity at its plants. Its main factory in California is now capable of making 590K vehicles per year, and new factories are under construction in Austin, TX and Berlin, Germany. 
Musk said that production at both plants is expected to begin in 2021, but it will take 12-18 months for the plants to reach full capacity. Additionally, Musk stated that the new Cybertruck pickup is on schedule to begin production in late 2021.
TSLA
 continues to excel as other auto makers recover from the depths of the pandemic and the resulting factory shutdowns. The sizable increase in regulatory credit sales somewhat tarnishes 
TSLA
's report, but the company's aggressive guidance of delivering 500K vehicles this year is capturing investors' attention.

"21-Oct-20  15:05 ET","TSLA","Tesla earnings preview - On steady production and healthy demand, electric vehicle maker has blown out expectations
  (426.87 
+4.93
)
After the close today, 
Tesla 
(
TSLA
) is scheduled to report Q3 earnings. A conference call is set to follow at 5:30 p.m. E.T. After ripping to all time highs on September 1, the stock cooled off and has traded within a $425-$450 range over the past couple of weeks.
For the quarter, analysts are expecting the electric vehicle maker to post EPS and revenue of $0.60 and $8.29 bln, respectively. 
Recall that in Q2, 
TSLA
 posted its fourth straight profitable quarter, prompting many to believe that the company would be included in the S&P 500. 
Even though 
TSLA
 cleared the final hurdle to be included in the index, the S&P 500 committee opted to pass on adding the company.
Despite COVID-related headwinds, 
TSLA
 has posted impressive quarterly results this year, crushing analysts' expectations. Last quarter, 
TSLA
 blew out the EPS forecast by $2.34, following beats of $1.45 in Q1 and $1.53 in 4Q19.
One caveat is that last quarter's blow out EPS result was inflated by record regulatory tax credit sales of $428 mln. 
TSLA
 sells these government issued credits to its competitors, which they use to offset the cost of making zero emission vehicles.
Still, 
TSLA
 has managed to keep production humming throughout the pandemic and demand has remained healthy, especially in China for its Model 3 vehicle.
In Q2, Model 3 and Model Y combined deliveries totaled 80,277, up 5% sequentially, which is quite impressive relative to other auto makers which struggled with double-digit declines.
On October 2, 
TSLA
 disclosed that it delivered nearly 140,000 vehicles in Q3, slightly above the 136K consensus estimate. That represents a robust 54% sequential jump, but, it's likely not strong enough to allow 
TSLA
 to meet its goal of 500K deliveries this year.
Over the first three quarters of FY20, 
TSLA
 has delivered about 319K vehicles.
The current consensus for FY20 deliveries is ~480K.
A key metric that will help determine whether 
TSLA
 easily outperforms bottom-line expectations again is automotive gross margin. Last quarter, automotive gross margin slipped to 18.7% from 20.0% in Q1 due to idle capacity charges and lower operational efficiency from various shutdowns.
TSLA
's expectations regarding the Cybertruck production timeline will also be important. Just prior to the company's ""Battery Day"" event in September, CEO Elon Musk tweeted ""... This affects long-term production, especially Semi, Cybertruck & Roadster, but what we announce will not reach serious high-volume production until 2022.""
This statement disappointed investors because the Cybertruck was expected to hit full-scale production in late 2021.
Lastly, Musk's commentary regarding mining plans will be a focal point. Securing enough lithium to produce 20 mln vehicles per year is a formidable challenge. To address that challenge, Musk reported on September 29 that 
TSLA
 secured its own lithium mining rights in Nevada.

  (1604.09 
+11.76
)
With shares nearly doubling since 
Tesla
 (
TSLA
) last reported earnings on April 29, the company faced an exceptionally high bar to hurdle regarding its 2Q20 performance. To avoid a likely steep sell-off, blow-out results and another profitable quarter was needed. 
TSLA
 delivered just that, generating EPS of $2.34, crushing the ($0.16) consensus estimate. In an environment in which the auto industry suffered a 30% decline in 1H20, 
TSLA
's Q2 revenue only fell by 5% to $6.04 bln, easily beating the $5.31 bln forecast.
The GAAP profit of $104 mln marks the company's fourth straight quarterly profit, paving the way for 
TSLA
 to be included in the S&P 500. The meteoric rise in 
TSLA
's stock price suggests that this bullish development was mostly priced into shares. Still, 
TSLA
's evolution to profitability is a significant fundamental achievement that makes the stock more appealing to a wider base of investors.
TSLA
 reported solid, better-than-expected Q2 vehicle deliveries of 90,650 on July 2. What was unknown was whether lower operating efficiency, resulting from plant shut-downs, would prevent the company from posting a profit.
Adjusted automotive gross margin did slide to 18.7% from 20.0% last quarter. However, this dip was mitigated by record regulatory tax credit sales of $428 mln. 
TSLA
 sells these government issued credits to its competitors, which they use to offset the cost of making zero emission vehicles.
If one wants to nit-pick at 
TSLA
's report, one could argue that the quality of the earnings beat is somewhat questionable due to inflated regulatory tax credit sales. Indeed, the degree of 
TSLA
's upside performance wouldn't have been as impressive without this inflation, but this doesn't negate the overall strong performance in our view.
Improvements in product and manufacturing costs, and a 12.5% yr/yr reduction in operating expenses to $951 mln, also positively impacted the company's profitability.
In addition to the quarterly results, 
TSLA
 had important news to share regarding its next production facility. 
The company has chosen Austin, TX as the location for its fourth plant. The 2,000 acre facility will house production for the Cybertruck and Tesla Semi, which is expected to be available for delivery in 2021. Also, Model 3 and Model Y sedans for the eastern U.S. market will be produced there.
Given the sky-high expectations, 
TSLA
 needed to astonish investors with strong Q2 results, while spurring excitement for future growth opportunities. The company achieved both goals, as reflected in the stock's move higher.

  (1577.52 
+9.16
)
After the close today, 
Tesla 
(
TSLA
) is scheduled to report Q2 results. Since the electric vehicle maker last reported earnings on April 29, the stock has rocketed higher, nearly doubling during this stretch. Given the massive rally, the bar will be set very high for 
TSLA
 tonight.
For the quarter, 
TSLA
 is expected to report a loss per share of ($0.28) and revenue of $5.3 bln, equating to a yr/yr decline of 16.5%. Due to COVID-19, 
TSLA
's Fremont, CA plant was shutdown from March 23 - May17, cutting into production.
Nonetheless, on July 2, 
TSLA
 still reported impressive Q2 production and delivery results. Specifically, the company produced 82,272 vehicles, down a modest 4.5% yr/yr, and delivered 90,650 vehicles, cruising past the ~74K consensus estimate.
The key catalyst for 
TSLA
's recent success hinges on soaring sales for its less-expensive Model 3 car in China. In May, 
TSLA
 sold 11,095 Model 3s in China, more than tripling the number sold in April.
The big question, though, is whether 
TSLA
 will churn out a fourth consecutive profitable quarter. If it does, the company will become eligible for inclusion into the S&P 500.
Beyond the prestige factor, the potential inclusion in the S&P 500 is important because index and passive funds would accumulate shares of the stock, providing a fresh round of demand.
TSLA
 has smashed analysts' EPS expectations over the past three quarters. After beating the EPS consensus by $2.19 in 3Q19, 
TSLA
 exceeded the EPS consensus estimate by $1.53 and $1.45 in 4Q19 and 1Q20, respectively.
On June 30, CEO Elon Musk stated in an internal letter to employees that the company could breakeven in Q2. Since then, analysts' loss per share estimates have been improving. About a month ago, the Street was expecting 
TSLA
 to report a loss per share of ($1.35).
The immediate attention will land on 
TSLA
's bottom line. But, also of importance will be the performance and commentary regarding 
TSLA
's Model Y crossover vehicle.
The company began deliveries of the new vehicle in mid-March, but demand doesn't appear to be as strong as anticipated. On July 13, Bloomberg reported that 
TSLA
 lowered the Model Y price by $3,000.

 On June 24, 2020, Tesla entered into an Indemnification Agreement with Elon Musk, Tesla's Chief Executive Officer, for an interim term of 90 days. During the Bridge Term, Tesla is resuming its annual evaluation of all available options for providing directors' and officers' indemnity coverage, which it had suspended during the height of shelter-in-place requirements related to the COVID-19 pandemic. As part of such process, Tesla intends to obtain a binding market quote for a directors' and officers' liability insurance policy with an aggregate coverage limit of $100 million, which Tesla will weigh in selecting an indemnity coverage option for a customary term following the end of the Bridge Term. 
 The Indemnification Agreement provides that Mr. Musk will provide, from his personal funds, directors' and officers' indemnity coverage to Tesla during the Bridge Term in the event such coverage is not indemnifiable by Tesla, up to a total of $100 million. In return, Tesla will pay Mr. Musk a one-time fee of $972,361. Tesla will also exercise reasonable best efforts to obtain the Market Quote, and will pay an additional amount to Mr. Musk to reconcile the one-time fee to be equal to the market-based premium for the Market Quote as prorated for 90 days and further discounted by 50%, if the latter amount is greater.

)
Reports Q1 (Mar) earnings of $1.24 per share, excluding non-recurring items, 
$1.45 
better than
 the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of ($0.21); revenues rose 31.8% year/year to $5.99 bln vs the $5.85 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.
Sequentially, our revenue was mainly impacted by lower deliveries, driven primarily by limitations on our ability to deliver vehicles towards the end of the quarter. As expected, our average selling price (ASP) declined further as our mix continues to shift from Model S and Model X to the more affordable Model 3 and Model Y.
Our automotive gross margin of 25.5% as well as total gross margin of 20.6% both reached their highest levels in 18 months.
Quarter-end cash and cash equivalents increased by $1.8B QoQ to $8.1B, driven mainly by our recent $2.3B capital raise and offset by negative quarterly free cash flow of $895M.
Model Y production also exceeded the first quarter of production of Model 3 in Shanghai, demonstrating continued improvements in program execution. Additionally, we achieved positive gross margin for Model Y in its first production quarter.
Our Gigafactory Shanghai ramp is progressing according to plan. Due to better than expected progress, we believe Model 3 will achieve a production rate of ~4,000/week (or ~200k/year extrapolated run rate) by mid-2020.
Based on the current progress, we are on track to start the first Model Y deliveries from Gigafactory Berlin in 2021.
Due to the wide range of potential outcomes, near-term guidance of net income and free cash flow would likely be inaccurate. We will again revisit our 2020 guidance in our Q2 update
.
While near-term profit guidance is currently on hold, we believe we will achieve industry leading operating margins and profitability with capacity expansion and localization plans underway.
We expect that production of both Model Y in Fremont and Model 3 in Shanghai will continue to ramp gradually through Q2. We are continuing to build capacity for Model Y at Gigafactory Berlin and Gigafactory Shanghai and remain on track to start deliveries from both locations in 2021. Lastly, we are shifting our first Tesla Semi deliveries to 2021.
 "
"29-Apr-20  10:58 ET","TSLA","Tesla First Quarter Earnings Preview
  (795.46 
+26.34
)
Tesla is scheduled to release Q1 results tonight after the close with a conference call which should begin around 6:30 p.m. ET.
The current Capital IQ Consensus Estimate calls for EPS of -$0.21 on sales of $5.85 bln, up 28% yr/yr.
On April 2, the company provided Q1 vehicle production and deliveries update; produced almost 103,000 vehicles and delivered approx. 88,400 vehicles.
Some interesting news items this quarter include:
CNBC 
reported in early February that Tesla was going to delay Model 3 deliveries in China on account of coronavirus outbreak.
In mid-February Tesla reportedly recalled more than 15K Model X SUVs in North America due to power steering issue.
In mid-February priced a $2 bln offering at $767/share.
On March 19 the company temporarily suspended production at its Fremont and NY facilities; said it believed it had liquidity sufficient to successfully navigate an extended period of uncertainty.
A 
Reuters 
report in late March suggested the company had cut on-site staff at its Nevada plant by 75% amid concerns about coronavirus.
On March 31 Oppenheimer, Wedbush, Credit Suisse, and JMP Securities were all out cautious on deliveries in the face of COVID-19 related headwinds.
On April 8, 
Reuters
 reported Tesla could furlough all non-essential workers and implement salary cuts due to the coronavirus.
On April 14, the 
WSJ 
reported that Tesla was asking landlords for rent reductions.
CNBC 
reported on Monday (4/27) that Tesla had asked people to return to work on Wednesday.
We'd also point out the staggering fall in oil prices. 
As many of Tesla's customers look to the pump to validate their purchase, it's likely increasingly more difficult to justify purchasing an EV right now with crude oil prices down more than 50% this month and prices at the pump considerably lower than this time a year ago.
Model Y production
 began in January with deliveries starting in March which Tesla noted was significantly ahead of schedule.
CEO Elon Musk is also slated to earn a significant option award if Tesla's valuation holds above $100 bln for six months.
 As part of an earlier-agreed compensation package, Musk would receive the option to purchase about 1.7 mln shares at $350.02 per share, which if sold at today's stock price would net Musk a hefty +$756 mln.
The stock's parabolic run in the latter half of 2019 and into the first few months of 2020 had shares top out near +300% from Oct. 2019 to the Feb. 4 peak.
 Action has considerably cooled off since then amid ongoing pressure from COVID-19 related lockdowns and supply chain difficulties across the globe. Still, shares cling to an aggressive +90% advance thus far in 2020 and trade at roughly 58x EV/EBITDA, a decent premium to fellow auto OEMs like 
Ford 
(F) at 16x, 
General Motors 
(GM) at roughly 8.5x, and 
Daimler 
(DDAIF) at 25x.

Tesla (

 will report fourth quarter results in a Q4 update on its website tomorrow afternoon. Chief Executive Elon Musk will host a call at 6:30 p.m. 
After the company preannounced upside deliveries earlier this month, focus will be on margins and delivery guidance for 2020. 
Tesla's stock has more than doubled since the company reported a surprise third quarter profit in late October. The stock broke out to a record high in late December before going parabolic in response to upside fourth quarter deliveries earlier this month.
 Last quarter, Tesla reiterated guidance for positive GAAP net income and free cash flow going forward, which did real damage to the short thesis on the stock. Demand for the Model 3 has remained strong, just like it did for the higher end Model S for many years. 
In the third quarter, automotive gross margin improved almost 400 basis points sequentially to 22.8%, well above estimates. Tesla cited dramatically improved operating efficiency. 
Tesla began deliveries of the Model 3 from its brand new Gigafactory in Shanghai this month. 
 Deliveries are expected to grow sequentially and annually going forward. 
Production for the Model Y mass market cross over SUV are expected to begin this summer (moved up from fall last quarter). 
Adjusted earnings are expected to be just over $5.50/share with revenue up 24% in 2020. Tesla is expected to a post a small adjusted net loss for 2019, but earnings estimates for 2019 were nearly $6 one year ago. 
 Expectations are sky high going into this report, as the stock's $100 bln valuation appears quite stretched. The stock trades at nearly 30x EV/EBITDA, a huge premium to fellow auto OEMs. Bulls would argue that Tesla deserves a technology or software-like multiple and that the vertically integrated clean energy company remains an attractive investment given its potential to further disrupt the transportation sector as the leading electric vehicle maker. Roughly 18% of the float was recently sold short, down from 26% heading into the last report.

Tesla (

 is seeing some selling interest in pre-market action that has its stock down nearly 4.0%. Several factors have come into play as a basis for the selling activity:
Morgan Stanley downgraded the stock to Underweight from Equal Weight. The firm raised its price target  from $250 to $360, which is still 30% below Wednesday's closing price.
According to a Dominion Cross-Sell report 
cited by CNBC.com
, Tesla's overall vehicle registrations in the fourth quarter declined by 46.5% in California.
Technical selling pressure as the stock, which is up 115% since the start of last October, is battling assertions that it is overbought, overextended, and overvalued. At Wednesday's close, 
TSLA

Compared to Q3 of 2018, the percentage of leased vehicles has tripled and alone has impacted revenue by the majority of the YoY decrease. Model 3 mix has increased while we have taken actions leading to the reduction of the ASP of our products. These ASP reductions are particularly impacted by the launch of the Standard Range trims of Model 3 and pricing actions earlier in the year. We are positioned to accelerate our growth further through Gigafactory Shanghai, Model Y and also through increasing build rates on our existing production lines. These capacity increases will allow for higher total vehicle deliveries and associated revenue. We also expect to gradually release nearly $500M of accumulated deferred revenue tied to Autopilot and Full Self Driving features. 
GAAP Automotive gross margin improved by 393bp QoQ to 22.8%, well above estimates (improved by 366bp QoQ excluding regulatory credits). Margin was impacted in part due to fundamental improvements in our operating efficiency, including higher fixed cost absorption, reductions in manufacturing and material costs and continued improvements in vehicle quality and in part due to Smart Summon-related deferred revenue recognition, FX and other non-recurring items. Improved gross profit combined with a decline in operating expenses resulted in material improvement of GAAP net income.
While total volumes are expected to grow by ~50% in 2019, this year our focus has been cost control and preparing for our next phase of growth

  (254.97 
-0.61
)
Tesla (
TSLA
) 
will report third quarter results this afternoon. Chief Executive Elon Musk will host a call at 5:30 PM.
 On October 2, Tesla announced record third quarter deliveries (total EVs +16% yr/yr to 97,000 with Model 3 +42% to 79,600 and Model S/X -37%) which narrowly missed estimates after an email from Elon Musk to employees targeting 100,000 deliveries was leaked in the press in the week prior.
Encouragingly, Tesla reported record net orders and a higher backlog entering Q4. Demand for the Model 3 remains strong, but a lower Model 3 ASP mix and falling sales of the Model S and X weigh on gross margins. 
Analysts expect third quarter adj. EPS of ($0.23) vs. a profit of $2.90 last year with revenue down 5% to $6.48 bln.  Last quarter, Tesla said the business has ""grown to the point of self-funding."" Tesla guided for positive quarterly free cash flow, with possible temporary exceptions, particularly around the launch and ramp of new products. Tesla continues to ""aim for positive GAAP net income in Q3 and the following quarters, although continuous volume growth, capacity expansion and cash generation will remain the main focus."" The Q3 GAAP EPS consensus is ($1.37). 
Last quarter, auto gross margins fell 125 bps Q/Q to 18.9%, but the company said gross margins improved 200 bps excluding regulatory credit revenue as progress in production costs offset a reduction in ASPs. 
Tesla will need to have a record fourth quarter in order to hit its 360,000-400,000 delivery goal for the year. 
Production of the Model 3 is expected to commence in China this quarter after its Shanghai Gigafactory was built in an astonishing six months. 
Tesla is never without controversy. The recent launch of its smart summon feature has led to complaints regarding safety issues. The release of this product may have unlocked some unearned revenue during the quarter. Recall, Tesla hosted an Autonomy Day in April, where Elon Musked boasted Tesla EVs would become an appreciating asset due to an plans for an autonomous fleet. Full self driving still seems to be many years away despite Musk's claims and Tesla's daring lead in the space.
Last quarter, the company said Model Y production was on track for the fall of 2020. 
Tesla is expected to lose more than $3/share (adjusted) this year. Tesla was expected to earn $3/share six months ago and $6/share at the beginning of the year. As a result, the stock is down 23% year-to-date. 
Tesla has a $46 bln market cap and trades at ~18x forward EV/EBITDA, a slight discount to 
Ferrari (RACE)
 but a notable premium the larger domestic automakers. Some 26% of the 141 mln share float was recently sold short. The options market is pricing in a ~8% move in the stock by Friday.

Total deliveries of 97K and Model 3 deliveries of 79.6K both narrowly missed estimates. Last week, a leaked email to employees from Elon Musk said the company had a shot at 100K deliveries.
Encouragingly, Tesla reported record net orders and a higher backlog entering Q4. The leaked email also said the company was tracking toward 110K net orders for the quarter. 
As a result, it appears we are seeing a bit of a sell-the-news reaction.
 Focus for some Tesla investors has shifted from deliveries to margins and cash flow. Last quarter, the company said it expects positive quarterly FCF, with possible temporary exceptions. 
From the Q2 Update Letter, ""We continue to aim for positive GAAP net income in Q3 and the following quarters, although continuous volume growth, capacity expansion and cash generation will remain the main focus.""

Combined with our public offering of equity and convertible bonds (net proceeds of $2.4 billion), we ended the quarter with $5.0 billion of cash and cash equivalents, the highest level in Tesla's history. This level of liquidity puts us in a comfortable position as we prepare to launch Model 3 production in China and Model Y production in the US. 
Auto gross margin -130 bps to 18.9% in spite of reductions in vehicle ASP and lower regulatory credit revenue; excluding regulatory credit revenue, automotive gross margin improved by ~200bp 
Outlook: This quarter, we are simplifying our approach to guidance. We are most focused on expanding our manufacturing footprint in new regions, launching new products and continuing to improve the customer experience, while generating and using cash sustainably. Local production and improved utilization of existing factories is essential to be cost competitive in each region. We remain on track to launch local production of the Model 3 in China by the end of the year and Model Y in Fremont by fall of 2020. We are also accelerating our European Gigafactory efforts and are hoping to finalize a location choice in the coming quarters. We are working to increase our deliveries sequentially and annually, with some expected fluctuations from seasonality. This is consistent with our previous guidance of 360,000 to 400,000 vehicle deliveries this year. Additionally, we expect positive quarterly free cash flow, with possible temporary exceptions, particularly around the launch and ramp of new products. We believe our business has grown to the point of being self-funding. We continue to aim for positive GAAP net income in Q3 and the following quarters, although continuous volume growth, capacity expansion and cash generation will remain the main focus. Our 2019 capex is expected to be about $1.5 to $2.0 billion, a reduction from prior guidance. We continue to find opportunities to improve capital efficiency and shift cash outflows to future periods. This estimate includes the development of our main projects, on the timelines referenced, and to expand our Supercharger and service networks.

Tesla (
TSLA
) 
will report second quarter results this afternoon. Chief Executive Elon Musk will host a call at 5:30 PM. 
The stock is up 18% since reporting record second quarter deliveries three weeks ago (but still down 20% year-to-date).  The company delivered a record 95,200 EVs during the quarter, in-line with the company's 90-100K guidance. Model 3 deliveries grew 320% yr/yr and 52% sequentially to 77,550 versus estimates near ~74K. Model S/X deliveries fell 21% yr/yr but grew 46% sequentially to 17,650. 
Perhaps more importantly, Tesla said that orders exceeded deliveries during the quarter, resulting in an increased backlog. Chief Executive Elon Musk reiterated that there is demand problem. 
The shorts are likely undeterred amid management turnover and reports of production quality issues with the Model 3. Demand may have been pulled forward like it did in 4Q18 after the Federal tax credit got cut in half for the second time this year, to $1,875. 
Now, focus on turn to the company's financials, more specifically, margins and cash flow. 
Analysts expect Q2 adj. EPS ($0.40) vs. ($3.06) last year with revenue up 61% to $6.44 bln. Tesla guided for a reduced net loss in the second quarter, from ($2.90) in the first quarter, a return to profitability in the third quarter -- consensus $0.32, and positive operating cash flow less capex going forward. 
Last quarter, adj. auto gross margins fell 438 bps Q/Q to 20.3%. 
Tesla has guided for FY19 deliveries +45-65% to $360-400K. 
EPS estimates for he year are ($1.45) vs. over $3 three months ago and almost $6 six months ago.  
Tesla has a $47 bln market cap and trades at ~18x EV/EBITDA, a slight discount to

Customer vehicles in transit at the end of the quarter were over 7,400. Due to the order-to-VIN matching process we described in our Q1 2019 Shareholder Letter, which we extended to Model S and Model X in Q2 to improve process efficiency, this metric has become less relevant. As a result, we do not plan to disclose the customer vehicles in transit metric going forward.""

On Wednesday evening, Tesla reported a larger than expected net loss and guided for a smaller net loss in the second quarter despite higher deliveries. The company guided for a return to profitability in the back half of the year and lofty reaffirmed delivery and gross margin targets.  
Concerns about demand and profitability/margins remain following recent price cuts even though Elon Musk dismissed demand distress on the call. Tesla also updated the drive train for the Model S and X on Wednesday.

Given its significantly higher volume, we build different variants of Model 3 in batches (including regional versions), and every vehicle that leaves the factory initially becomes inventory. While in inventory, those vehicles are then matched to a specific order made by each customer. As this was our first quarter delivering Model 3 outside of North America, we faced challenges in ramping our logistics channels and increasing the capacity of our international delivery operations. In addition to these factors, with a massive number of cars being shipped globally from a single factory in Fremont, the international expansion of Model 3 unavoidably resulted in longer average shipping times and increased vehicles in transit. Despite this, our global Model S, Model X and Model 3 inventory (including vehicles in transit and vehicles owned by our sales and service organizations) at the end of Q1 equaled 30 days of sales, less than half of US industry average and in line with our historical numbers.
 Although we are driving towards higher internal goals, we reaffirm our prior guidance of 360,000 to 400,000 vehicle deliveries in 2019, representing an increase of approximately 45% to 65% compared to 2018. Please note that vehicle production will be significantly higher than deliveries, as it takes several weeks to transport cars from California to distant customers, especially in other countries, where they must also be processed by customs. Deliveries, production and customer orders, which are all materially different, are often conflated when analyzing Tesla. If our Gigafactory Shanghai is able to reach volume production early in Q4 this year, we may be able to produce as many as 500,000 vehicles globally in 2019. This is an aggressive schedule, but it is what we are targeting. However, based on what we know today, being able to produce over 500,000 vehicles globally in the 12-month period ending June 30, 2020 does appear very likely. 
We continue to target a 25% non-GAAP gross margin on Model S, Model X and Model 3, depending on variant mix and option take rates as our product offerings change. In response to the operational challenges we experienced with international expansion in Q1, we are in the process of balancing our regional vehicle builds throughout the quarter. This provides an opportunity for additional cost efficiencies in our factory, supply chain, logistics operations and delivery centers. With the recently announced product improvements on Model S and Model X, as well as continued expansion of Model 3 globally, we expect our order rate to continue to increase throughout the year as our production levels increase. 
We believe we will deliver between 90,000 and 100,000 vehicles in Q2. Operating cash flow less capex should be positive in every quarter including Q2. As the impact of higher deliveries and cost reduction take full effect, we expect to return to profitability in Q3 and significantly reduce our loss in Q2. 
The long-range version of Model Y will be an all-electric compact SUV priced at $48,000, roughly $20,000 less than other all-electric SUVs. Given the well-appointed standard equipment, superior acceleration and handling, interior size and up to 300 mile range that we expect for Model Y and the size of the addressable market, we believe it will ultimately have higher sales than Model S, Model X and Model 3 combined.

Tesla (
TSLA
)
 will report first quarter results in a Shareholder Letter on its website soon after the bell and Elon Musk will host a call at 18:30. 
Analysts expect Q1 adjusted EPS of ($0.94) vs. ($3.35) last year with revenue up 52% to $5.18 bln. 
Tesla was expected to post a $0.54/share non-GAAP profit before it announced weak deliveries earlier this month. Model 3 deliveries came in at 50,900 versus estimates closer to 55,000. Tesla previously said that deliveries would fall sequentially (from 63,359 in the fourth quarter) as the company started shipping to Europe and China. Tesla said 10,600 vehicles were in transit to customers globally at the end of the first quarter as delivering vehicles worldwide from the Bay Area in California presents logistical challenges. The company can't recognize revenue for vehicles until customers take delivery.
The other headwind during the quarter came from the fact that the US Federal tax credit for electric vehicles was cut in half to $3,750 starting on January 1, which pulled demand forward into the fourth quarter of 2018. 
As a result, deliveries of the Model S and Model X fell 44% yr/yr combined. Cannibalization from the Model 3 may also be impacting sales. 
 For the first time ever, the demand argument from Bears has substance. This year, Tesla has cut prices more than once, introduced the long-awaited $35K model 3 and even introduced a leasing option for the Model 3, which Elon musk previously said would weigh on GAAP financials. However, last quarter, Mr. Musk estimated Model 3 demand at 700-800K/year. 
At its Autonomy Day on Monday, Tesla unveiled its own chip that enables full self driving (FSD) capabilities. Elon Musk said FSD would work later this year when the software caught up; he even said that the Tesla Network would feature self-driving robotaxis next year. Per usual, analysts are skeptical of Musk's loft targets. It appears Musk is making a hard marketing push. 
Elon Musk said that autonomous efforts are driving most of its costs. He said that Tesla would aim for operating cash flow neutral as it builds out the autonomous fleet, which would then be extremely cash flow positive. That seemed to walk back prior guidance for profitability and positive cash flow going forward. This morning the company announced a new drive train for the Model S and X to spur demand. 
Tesla has guided for FY19 deliveries +45-65% to 360-400K. EPS estimates for the year at $3.60/share are down ~40% from two months ago.
Tesla has a $45 bln market cap and traded at ~20x EV/EBITDA, on par with Ferrari (RACE) but much more expensive than larger auto peers.
The stock has underperformed and currently trades near the low end of the $260-380/share range it has trade in for the last two years.
Some 33 mln shares were recently sold short (~26% of the float). The options market is pricing in a 8% move.

  (278.61

Shares of 
Tesla
 (
TSLA
 278.61, -11.34) have had a weak start to today's session, trading lower by 3.9%, after the company unveiled the Model Y crossover last evening. 
Why the negative market reaction?
 
 Unlike previous product announcements from Tesla, this one lacked headline-grabbing features like ""ludicrous mode"" or ""bioweapon defense mode."" Instead, Tesla revealed a vehicle that looks like a slightly raised Model 3. This adds to the concern that the product launch was rushed in order to invite new deposits that would support the company's cash position. Back in 2017, CEO Elon Musk said that the Model Y would be built on a different platform than the Model 3, but last night's announcement suggests otherwise. The company has not provided specific dimensions of the new vehicle, which would have helped diffuse these concerns. 
Tesla's website states that production of the new Model Y is expected to begin late next year. This will fuel concerns that some customers who were ready to purchase a Tesla vehicle will delay their purchase until the Model Y is launched. In other words, future Model Y sales could cannibalize current Model 3 sales at a time when the company needs to sell as many vehicles as it can.
 It is currently unclear where Tesla will produce this vehicle, but adding a new production line will almost certainly require more capital spending. 
The Model Y reveal took place at a time of growing questions about the strength of demand for Tesla vehicles. Deliveries that have taken place so far in 2019 have been well below levels seen at the end of 2018 while early sales in Europe have also been underwhelming. 
While reserving a Model Y requires a $2,500 deposit, it is not entirely clear if that deposit will guarantee prompt delivery. Tesla also took deposits for the Model 3, but the vehicle launch was followed by reports about customers who ordered the vehicle after it was launched, and had the vehicle delivered shortly after placing their order, which meant that they received their vehicle ahead of many reservation holders.
With today's decline, shares of Tesla are down 13.0% since the company announced price cuts for all its vehicles and plans to close most of its showrooms.

)
Last evening, 
Tesla
 (
TSLA
 289.42, -5.37) CEO Elon Musk announced, via a 
tweet
, that Tesla will unveil a Model Y SUV on March 14. Mr. Musk said that the vehicle will be about 10% bigger than the Model 3 and that it will also cost about 10% more. Shares of Tesla started the day about 1.0% higher, but the opening gain was surrendered in short order. 
What's behind the negative response?
 
The timing of the announcement is curious, considering Tesla lowered the prices of all its vehicles and announced plans last Thursday evening to close most of its showrooms. With the new product announcement coming just a few days later, there has been speculation that the company's announcement on Thursday did not generate as strong of a reaction among its customers as the company had hoped for. 
On Friday, Tesla paid $920 million to settle a convertible bond obligation. The company reported having cash and cash equivalents of $3.69 billion at the end of 2018 and Mr. Musk has been adamant about not wanting to conduct another equity offering to raise funds. Meanwhile, sales in January and February were significantly lower than what was seen during the final months of 2018, suggesting the product announcement could be aimed at raising funds through deposits—a tactic the company has used in the past. 
With the Model Y unveiling scheduled for ten days from now, there are concerns that customers who would have ordered a Model 3 (or any other vehicle offered by Tesla) will now wait to see the March 14 unveiling before making a purchase decision.

""I want to be clear. I do not respect the SEC. I do not respect them"", said 
Tesla
 (
TSLA
 296.83, -23.05) CEO Elon Musk during a 
60 Minutes
 interview, which aired on December 9. The mercurial CEO reminded investors of his stance yesterday when he disseminated material information through an invite-only conference call that was open to select reporters. The company filed an 8-K this morning, more than 13 hours after discussing developments that will have significant implications for the company's profitability. 
During yesterday's call, the Tesla CEO announced that base-level Model 3 vehicles are now available for $35,000 while a ""Standard Range Plus"" version will begin selling for $37,000. The company also lowered prices on Model S and Model X vehicles, representing the third round of price cuts this year, and announced it will close most of its stores worldwide, transitioning to online-only ordering.
 Mr. Musk conceded that the company will not be profitable during the first quarter, which has been a viable excuse for stock owners to dial back exposure after a 9% gain this week alone. The implications of yesterday's announcement go deeper than that, though, and call into question the company's high-growth story. 
What does yesterday's announcement suggest about the health of Tesla's market? 
During the Q4 conference call, Mr. Musk said the company expects to introduce the standard range Model 3 (i.e. the $35,000 version) sometime in the middle of 2019. This was based on the assumption that the company will spend the early months of 2019 satisfying demand for the premium version from Europe after the Model 3 received regulatory approval. The company now says the standard range Model 3 will be delivered in two to four weeks, 
suggesting European demand for higher-priced versions has already been exhausted or is close to being exhausted.
 
During yesterday's call, Mr. Musk was reportedly asked about the expected profit margin on the $35,000 version of the Model 3, to which he reportedly responded, ""Yeah, we're not going to answer questions like that. Next question."" 
The refusal to address an essential question about margins will lead to speculation that the $35,000 version of the Model 3 is actually an unsold premium version of the vehicle with software that limits the vehicle's range. Our concern is
 that margins on these sales might not only be non-existent, but could be negative, considering the cost of producing these vehicles would not be any lower than the cost of producing the premium version.
 
Mr. Musk said  the company will close most of its showrooms around the world, which implies a significant reduction in the company's sales force. 
This type of a move indicates aggressive cost-cutting efforts, which is inconsistent with actions that would be undertaken by a company that is truly in high-growth mode.
 Furthermore, the company said in its Q4 earnings release that SolarCity, Tesla's division responsible for selling solar panels for homes, will push sales through Tesla stores, but the majority of these locations are now slated to close. This also suggests the company is in retrenchment mode, rather than growth mode.
Shares of Tesla have seen some pressure today, but the stock maintains a valuation that is orders of magnitude richer than that of its competitors. In the past, the premium was attributed to expectations that Tesla would be the ""automaker of the future,"" but competition is rising and so are doubts about Tesla's ability to satisfy the high expectations of growth investors well into the future that are embedded in its premium valuation.

We are incredibly excited to announce that the standard Model 3, with 220 miles of range, a top speed of 130 mph and 0-60 mph acceleration of 5.6 seconds is now available at $35,000! Although lower in cost, it is built to achieve the same perfect 5-star safety rating as the longer-ranged version, which has the lowest probability of injury of any car ever tested by the U.S. Government.
To achieve these prices while remaining financially sustainable, Tesla is shifting sales worldwide to online only.
Shifting all sales online, combined with other ongoing cost efficiencies, will enable us to lower all vehicle prices by about 6% on average, allowing us to achieve the $35,000 Model 3 price point earlier than we expected. Over the next few months, we will be winding down many of our stores, with a small number of stores in high-traffic locations remaining as galleries, showcases and Tesla information centers.

$0.09 
worse than
 the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $2.02. Revenue +120% to $7.23 bln vs. $7.09 bln consensus. Operating income in Q4 remained stable at $414 million despite a sequential decline in revenue from the sale of regulatory credits, higher import duties on components from China, a price reduction for Model S and Model X in China, and the introduction of a lower-priced mid-range version of Model 3. Free cash flow (operating cash flow less capital expenditures) also improved sequentially in Q4 to $910 million. 
 We have sufficient cash on hand to comfortably settle in cash our convertible bond that will mature in March 2019. 
In 2019, full-year Model 3 volumes will grow substantially over 2018 due to a full year of high production rates at our Fremont facility. Also, by the end of this year we are expecting to start producing Model 3 vehicles at our Gigafactory Shanghai using a complete vehicle production line.  Additionally, this year we will start tooling for Model Y to achieve volume production by the end of 2020, most likely at Gigafactory 1. All of these activities are setting us up for very significant annual growth in 2019 and beyond.
Model 3 production volumes in Fremont should gradually continue to grow throughout 2019 and reach a sustained rate of 7,000 units per week by the end of the year. 
Because this high level of demand presumably represented a pull-forward, we are expecting our Model S and Model X deliveries in Q1 2019 to be slightly below Q1 2018. We continue to target a 25% Model 3 non-GAAP gross margin at some point in 2019. 
The gap between production and deliveries in Q1 will create a temporary but predictable dip in our revenues and earnings. As a result, our optimistic target is to achieve a very small GAAP net income in Q1, but that will require us to successfully execute on many fronts including handling logistics and delivery challenges in Europe and China. The higher in-transit inventory will also negatively impact operating cash flows in Q1. 
In total, we are expecting to deliver 360,000 to 400,000 vehicles in 2019, representing a growth of ~45% to 65% compared to 2018. In this range, we are expecting to have positive GAAP net income and to generate positive free cash flow (operating cash flow less capex) in every quarter beyond Q1 2019. We believe these results will be substantially driven by our restructuring action and the ongoing financial discipline with which we are managing the business. 
Our 2019 capex, the vast majority of which will be to grow our capacity and develop new vehicles, is expected to be about $2.5 billion. 
We believe this amount should be sufficient to continue to develop our main projects, such as Gigafactory Shanghai, Model Y and Tesla Semi, as well as for the further expansion of our Supercharger, service and retail networks. We expect to arrange financing through local banks in China to fund most of the capex for Gigafactory Shanghai.

Tesla 
(
TSLA
) will report fourth quarter results in a Shareholder Letter on its website soon after the bell and Elon Musk will host a call at 18:30. 
  Tesla preannounced production and delivery figures that narrowly missed estimates on January 2.  Fourth quarter production was up 8% sequentially to 86,555 and deliveries were up 8% sequentially to 90,700.  Deliveries of the Model 3 grew 13% sequentially to 63,150, narrowly missing estimates. Tesla noted that Q4 Model 3 deliveries were limited to mid- and higher-priced variants, cash/loan transactions, and North American customers only. More than three quarters of Model 3 orders in Q4 came from new customers, rather than reservation holders. ""There remain significant opportunities to continue to grow Model 3 sales by expanding to international markets, introducing lower-priced variants and offering leasing. International deliveries in Europe and China will start in February 2019."" 
The company also announced a $2,000 price reduction on its EVs in the U.S. to offset the reduction of the federal EV tax credit to $3,750 from $7,500 starting this year. While Tesla is no stranger to missed forecasts, the disappointing result stoked fears about the evolving investment thesis. 
Demand has never been an issue in the past, but bears remain skeptical about demand for the Model 3, especially after price cuts. 
On January 18, Tesla announced its GAAP profit for the fourth quarter would be smaller than in Q3 ($1.75/share vs. current consensus of $1.05). The company also announced it was laying off 7% of its staff in order achieve economies of scale to bring a $35K Model 3 to market. 
 Tesla reported blow out Q3 results last quarter as Elon Musk appeared to pull a rabbit out of his hat with a significant profit and free cash flow. The Model 3 was the top selling premium mid-sized sedan in the US.  
Tesla guided for positive cash flow in every quarter going forward. The company realized significant cost improvement and called for further progress in that regard.  Elon Musk estimated Model 3 demand at 500K-1M annually. If that pans out, Tesla could represent a solid growth story going forward. Mr. Musk said that Tesla has the most exciting product road map of any company and the Model Y crossover could begin production next year.
 Bears still point to demand and liquidity concerns. The company will owe $920 million for a convertible bond on March 1 if the stock is below $360. Tesla had $3 bln in cash and equivalents and $8.8 bln in net debt as of Q3.
Analysts expect adjusted EPS of $2.02 (vs. a $3.04 loss last year) with revenue up 116% to $7.09 billion. Tesla guided for a for Model 3 gross margin to remain stable in Q4 as manufacturing efficiencies and fixed cost absorption offset a slightly lower trim mix and the negative impact of tariffs from Chinese sourced components. 
Analysts expect FY19 EPS of ~$6 (vs. a $1.34 loss in 2018) with revenue up 35% to $28.7 billion.
  Tesla has a $53 billion market cap and trades at just over 2x FY19 sales, 17x EBITDA or 50x EPS. The weekly options imply an ~10% move in the stock by Friday. Some 21% of the 125M share float is sold short.

 315.25, -32.06) have fallen 9.2% to their 200-day moving average (315.15) after an internal email from CEO Elon Musk announced that that the company will reduce its full-time employee headcount by about 7.0%.
In his email to employees, Mr. Musk said that the production rate of the Model 3 sedan will need to increase despite the cuts. This might remind some investors of last year's stretch that was dubbed ""production hell"" by the company. Tesla later admitted that ""production hell"" was self-inflicted due to overreliance on automation.
In today's email, Mr. Musk cautioned that the road ahead is ""very difficult"", which appears to be an acknowledgment of growing competition from established auto companies.
Jaguar began delivering its I-PACE SUV in late 2018 while Audi will begin delivering its e-tron SUV this spring. In addition, industry giants like 
Toyota
 (TM 125.50, +0.58) and 
Volkswagen
 (VWAG 16.73, +0.10) are planning to launch electric vehicles of their own in the near future.
Today's news indicates that the company is stepping up its cost-cutting efforts and it contrasts with the CEO's optimistic outlook on last quarter's earnings call when the company reported its first quarterly profit since launching the Model 3.  On a related note, Mr. Musk said earlier in the week that the company's customer referral plan would be ending Feb. 1 because it was adding too much cost to the cars.
Today's email also notes that the company expects to report a Q4 profit, which will be smaller than last quarter's profit. The email goes on to say that the company expects to generate just a ""tiny profit"" during the ongoing quarter (Q1). Tesla is expected to report its Q4 results during the first week of February.

 In Q4, preliminary, unaudited results indicate that we again made a GAAP profit, but less than Q3 (Q3 actual EPS $2.90; Q4 Capital IQ consensus $2.28).
 This quarter, as with Q3, shipment of higher priced Model 3 variants (this time to Europe and Asia) will hopefully allow us, with great difficulty, effort and some luck, to target a tiny profit.""
""Sorry for all these numbers, but I want to make sure that you know all the facts and figures and 
understand that the road ahead is very difficult.""
""As a result of the above, we unfortunately have no choice but to reduce full-time employee headcount by approximately 7% (we grew by 30% last year, which is more than we can support) and retain only the most critical temps and contractors. Tesla will need to make these cuts while increasing the Model 3 production rate and making many manufacturing engineering improvements in the coming months. Higher volume and manufacturing design improvements are crucial for Tesla to achieve the economies of scale required to manufacture the standard range (220 mile), standard interior Model 3 at $35k and still be a viable company. There isn't any other way.""

  (332.80)
In Q4, we produced and delivered at the rate of nearly 1,000 vehicles per day, setting new company records for both production and deliveries.  
Production in Q4 grew to 86,555 vehicles, 8% more than our prior all-time high in Q3. This included: 
61,394 Model 3 vehicles, in line with our guidance and 15% more than Q3.  
25,161 Model S and X vehicles, consistent with our long-term run rate of ~100,000 per year. 
Q4 deliveries grew to 90,700 vehicles, which was 8% more than our prior all time-high in Q3. 
This included 63,150 Model 3 (13% growth over Q3 but below consensus near 65K)
, 13,500 Model S, and 14,050 Model X vehicles. 
In 2018, we delivered a total of 245,240 vehicles: 145,846 Model 3 and 99,394 Model S and X. To put our growth into perspective, we delivered almost as many vehicles in 2018 as we did in all prior years combined. 
Q4 Model 3 deliveries were limited to mid- and higher-priced variants, cash/loan transactions, and North American customers only. More than three quarters of Model 3 orders in Q4 came from new customers, rather than reservation holders. 
There remain significant opportunities to continue to grow Model 3 sales by expanding to international markets, introducing lower-priced variants and offering leasing. International deliveries in Europe and China will start in February 2019. Expansion of Model 3 sales to other markets, including with a right-hand drive variant, will occur later in 2019. 
1,010 Model 3 vehicles and 1,897 Model S and X vehicles were in transit to customers at the end of Q4, and will be delivered in early Q1 2019. Our inventory levels remain the smallest in the automotive industry, and we were able to reduce vehicles in transit to customers by significantly improving our logistics system in North America. 
Moving beyond the success of Q4, we are taking steps to partially absorb the reduction of the federal EV tax credit (which, as of January 1st, dropped from $7,500 to $3,750). Starting today, we are reducing the price of Model S, Model X and Model 3 vehicles in the U.S. by $2,000. Customers can apply to receive the $3,750 federal tax credit for new deliveries starting on January 1, 2019, and may also be eligible for several state and local electric vehicle and utility incentives, which range up to $4,000. Combined with the reduced costs of maintenance and of charging a Tesla versus paying for gas at the pump -- which can result in up to $100 per month or more in savings -- this means our vehicles are even more affordable than similarly priced gasoline vehicles. 
Tesla's achievements in 2018 likely represent the biggest single-year growth in the history of the automotive industry. We started the year with a delivery run rate of about 120,000 vehicles per year and ended it at more than 350,000 vehicles per year -- an increase of almost 3X. As a result, we're starting to make a tangible impact on accelerating the world to sustainable energy. Additionally, 2018 was the first time in decades that an American car -- the Model 3 -- was the best-selling premium vehicle in the U.S. for the full year, with U.S. sales of Model 3 roughly double those of the runner up.

Moreover, we expect that the cash we generate from our core operations will generally be sufficient to cover our future capital expenditures and to pay down our near-term debt obligations, although we may choose to seek alternative financing sources.

  (288.50 
-5.64
)
Tesla (
TSLA
) is up 12% in extended trade after reporting blow-out third quarter results. 
  Pretty much everyone thought Elon Musk was crazy when he guided for profitability in Q3 and Q4 but he handily delivered this afternoon.  The company reported Q3 GAAP net income of $312 million, well above estimates for a ($169) million net loss and guidance for profitability. Free cash flow was $881M supported by operating cash flow of $1.4B.
Model 3 was the best-selling car in the US in terms of revenue and the 5th best-selling car in terms of volume. 
Naysayers and shortsellers have been skeptical of the company's production, margins, demand and less than stellar balance sheet, but it seems Elon Musk has proved all of them wrong. 
Model 3 gross margin came in over 20% vs. 15% guidance. The company reaffirmed expectations for a profitable Q4 with positive FCF. Total cash increased by $731 million to $3.0 billion.
Model 3 is attracting customers of both premium and non-premium brands, making it a truly mainstream product. Of the 455,000 net reservations the company reported in August 2017, less than 20% have cancelled. 
Tesla is expecting most of the remaining reservations to gradually convert to orders as it launches more versions of Model 3, introduce other financing options, and begin sales outside North America.
It's hard to imagine some of the short sellers will give up in the current market conditions. Many highly valued stocks have seen a sell-the-news reaction following strong reports in recent weeks. Still, it appears most of the short theses have been disproven this afternoon -- there are ~33M shares short. While the $50 billion valuation isn't cheap, you could make the case that the 3x sales multiple is attractive given the growth outlook. The conference call stats at 6:30 this evening.

Free cash flow of $881M supported by operating cash flow of $1.4B 
At an average Model 3 production rate of about 4,300 per week in Q3 (excluding planned shutdowns), Model 3 gross margin grew very significantly to above 20%. The mix of the Model 3 Performance version was only slightly higher than the Performance mix of Model S and X. 
Guidance: Reaffirm prior guidance that we expect to again achieve positive GAAP net income in Q4. ""Similarly, in Q4, we continue to expect to generate positive cash from operating cash flows net of capital expenditures, as well as the normal inflow of cash received from nonrecourse financing activities on leased vehicles and solar products. Our cash position should remain at least flat in spite of our plan to repay $230 million of convertible notes in cash during Q4. Our total 2018 capex, the vast majority of which is to grow our capacity, is expected to be slightly below $2.5 billion, consistent with our prior guidance Model 3 quarterly production and deliveries should continue to increase in Q4 compared to Q3. Our target of delivering 100,000 Model S and X vehicles this year remains unchanged. We expect gross margin for Model 3 to remain stable in Q4 as manufacturing efficiencies and fixed cost absorption offset a slightly lower trim mix and the negative impact of tariffs from Chinese sourced components. Gross margin for Model S and X will likely decline slightly in Q4, as we expect that the sequential increase in tariffs in Q4 from Chinese sourced components will be only partially offset by increased manufacturing cost efficiencies. For all three vehicles, additional tariffs in Q4 on parts sourced from China will impact our gross profit negatively by roughly $50 million.""

)
Tesla 
(
TSLA
) will report third quarter results in a Shareholder Letter on its website soon after the bell and Elon Musk will host a call at 18:30. Earnings come one week earlier than normal, which has fueled speculation about positive results after the company announced the release date on Monday night. 
On October 3, the company announced strong third quarter production and deliveries. Model 3 production grew 86% Q/Q to 53.3K, in-line with 50-55K guidance. Deliveries grew 203% Q/Q to 55,840 vehicles.
The Model 3 is the top selling premium mid-sized sedan in the US. 
Days before that, the stock fell after the SEC announced charges against Elon Musk for misleading investors when he tweeted 'funding secured' about taking the company private at $420/share. He quickly settled, agreeing to relinquish the Chairman role after the stock crashed in response to the charges. 
Now, the focus turns to the financials. 
Elon Musk guided for GAAP profitability and positive free cash flow in the second half of the year. The company has been cutting operating expenses and pulling back on cap-ex as a result. Tesla guided for Model 3 gross margin of 15% in Q3 and 20% in Q4 from ‘slightly positive' in Q2 as production scales. 
Analysts expect Q3 adjusted EPS of ($0.09) vs. ($2.92) last year with revenue up 111% to $6.29 bln. Assuming liquidity doesn't get much worse, a modest net loss would likely be a win for investors.
If demand for the Model 3 is anything like it was for the Model S, the company should be able to post some impressive growth going forward. 
Last week, the company started selling a cheaper version of the Model 3 (smaller battery). The Model 3 has only been for sale in North America and the company does little to no marketing so short seller claims of a lack of demand appear to be misplaced. and the company does little to no marketing so 
The balance sheet is poor so a near term capital raise would remove an overhang on the stock. 26% of the float is sold short.
Tesla has a $50 billion market cap and trades at just over 3x sales or 40x EBITDA. The weekly options imply an ~11% move in the stock by Friday.

In Q3, the co produced 80,142 vehicles, 50% more than our prior all-time high in Q2, 
including:
53,239 Model 3 vehicles, which was in line with guidance and almost double the volume of Q2. 
During Q3, the co transitioned Model 3 production from entirely rear wheel drive at 
the beginning of the quarter to almost entirely dual motor during the last few 
weeks of the quarter. This added significant complexity, but the co says it successfully 
executed this transition and ultimately produced more dual motor than rear wheel 
drive cars in Q3.
In the last week of the quarter, the co produced over 5,300 Model 
3 vehicles, almost all of which were dual motor, meaning that it achieved a 
production rate of more than 10,000 drive units per week. 
26,903 Model S and X vehicles, which was slightly higher than Q2 and in line 
with our full-year guidance.
Q3 deliveries totaled 83,500 vehicles: 55,840 Model 3, 14,470 Model S, and 
13,190 Model X.  Q3 Model 3 deliveries were limited 
to higher-priced variants, cash/loan transactions, and North American customers 
only. There remain significant opportunities to grow the addressable market for 
Model 3 by introducing leasing, standard battery and other lower-priced variants 
of the car, and by starting international deliveries.

Shares are under heavy pressure this morning, sparked by the surprising resignation of Chief Accounting Officer Dave Morton after just a month with the company.
Headlines
 shortly after that the company's Chief People Officer Gaby Toledano would not be returning to the company from her leave only added fuel to the fire. 
Tesla and Elon Musk were already in the 
headlines
 early this morning, albeit with a limited reaction in Tesla's share price, after Musk participated in a podcast interview with comedian Joe Rogan, and could be seen smoking marijuana, which is legal in California. Musk has previously been 
quizzed
 on his use of marijuana after his now infamous proposal to take Tesla private at the off-the-cuff price of $420, a number closely aligned with marijuana use.
