"20-Jul-23  10:14 ET","TSLA","Tesla fails to steer around margin concerns in Q2, sending shares in reverse
  (273.55 
-17.71
)
Record vehicle deliveries and moderating raw materials prices helped 
Tesla
 (
TSLA
) drive past 2Q23 EPS and revenue expectations, but the EV makers' declining margins, aggressive investment plans, and warning that more price cuts may be on the way have the stock in reverse today.
With shares skyrocketing by about 140% this year, resulting in a steep 1-year forward P/E of around 60x, 
TSLA
 had little room for error. While there are plenty of positives, including a reaffirm of FY23 production of 1.8 mln vehicles, the blemishes are significant enough to elicit a profit-taking pullback.
Heading into the report, a popular narrative was that 
TSLA
's margins were set to stabilize in Q2, setting the stage for meaningful improvements in 2H23. Now, however, that presumption looks premature after 
TSLA
's automotive gross margin slipped to about 18%, while GAAP gross margin dove by 682 bps yr/yr to 18.2%, missing expectations. 
The bigger issue, though, is that Elon Musk signaled that more margin-eroding price cuts could soon be on the way as the EV price war rages on. Compared to a year ago, the average selling price has already fallen by nearly 20%.
After digesting that news, earnings call participants were greeted by Musk's proclamation that 
TSLA
 will spend more than $1.0 bln by the end of 2024 to develop a supercomputer called ""Dojo."" That disclosure isn't sitting too well with investors who are becoming increasingly anxious about 
TSLA
's profitability. 
In typical Musk fashion, the eccentric CEO promised that the investments in Dojo, which is accumulating massive amounts of video data from 
TSLA
 vehicles, will ultimately make the company's current financial metrics ""look silly."" Dojo will be used to power 
TSLA
's full self-driving (FSD) technology and is viewed by Musk as the key to substantially increasing the value of current and future vehicles.
Musk is comfortable with the idea of sacrificing margins for volume since more cars on the road now equates to greater FSD-related revenue down the road. Of course, Musk has over-promised and under-delivered on the development of FSD, so investors are taking his statements with a grain of salt. 
On that note, during the earnings call, he said that he thinks FSD will be better than human driving capability by the end of this year.
Speaking of ""looking silly"", the Cybertruck was another main topic last night, with Musk seemingly walking back the expectation that deliveries will begin in Q1. Instead, he simply stated that the first deliveries are slated for later this year and that production will gradually increase in 2024.
Overall, it's a mixed bag for 
TSLA
 with sales remaining very healthy, but at the expense of margins. Participants wanted to come away from this report with the feeling that margins have bottomed out and are set to improve in 2H, but that didn't happen, resulting in a profit-taking sell-off.

The company achieved record vehicle production and deliveries.

The company continues to target 1.8mm vehicle deliveries this year, although it expects that Q3 production will be a little bit down because of summer shutdowns for a lot of factory upgrades.
The short-term variances in gross margin and profitability really are minor relative to the long-term picture.
When interest rates rise, the company said it has to reduce the price of the car because the interest payments increase the price of the car.

After the close, 
Tesla 
(
TSLA
) is scheduled to report 2Q23 earnings with a conference call set to follow at 5:30 p.m. ET. The electric vehicle maker's earnings report is expected to be posted on the Investor Relations page of its website at about 4:05 p.m., followed soon thereafter by a press release.
The current FactSet consensus estimate stands at EPS of $0.80 and $24.2 bln, reflecting an estimated yr/yr EPS decline of 65% on a 43% increase in revenue.
On July 3, 
TSLA
 reported record Q2 deliveries of 466,140 (+83% yr/yr), exceeding expectations while illustrating that its aggressive price-cutting strategy has amped up demand
. 
Similar to last quarter, 
TSLA
's automotive gross margin (excluding regulatory credits) will be under the spotlight as participants assess the impact of the company's price cuts.
 In Q1, automotive gross margin cratered by five percentage points sequentially to about 16%, while 
TSLA
's overall gross margin of 19% fell well short of estimates.
The general expectation among analysts is that margins will bottom out this quarter before improving in 2H23. With production and volumes ramping up at the Austin, TX and Berlin, Germany factories, manufacturing efficiencies should be improving, providing a boost to automotive gross margins.
The big news this week was that 
TSLA
 built its first Cybertruck at the Austin, TX factory
. During the Q1 earnings call in April, Elon Musk commented that there's a ""tremendous amount of demand"" for Cybertruck, which represents 
TSLA
's first new vehicle launch since it introduced the Model Y SUV in 2020. However, Cybertruck won't move the needle much this year in terms of deliveries and revenue as 
TSLA
 gradually ramps up production. Next year, though, Cybertruck is poised to become a significant growth catalyst.
TSLA
's production guidance, which should be provided in the shareholder deck, will also be closely monitored. Last quarter, the company reaffirmed its expectation to deliver about 1.8 mln vehicles in FY23
, representing impressive yr/yr growth of 31%. Elon Musk upped the ante during the earnings call, though, stating that the company may be able to reach the 2.0 mln mark this year for deliveries.
The stock is red-hot heading into the report, soaring by about 140% on a year-to-date basis. In turn, the stock's valuation has reached sky-high levels with a 1-year forward P/E of around 60x.
 The impressive rally and rich valuation raises the risk of a sell-the-news reaction, but it's also worth keeping in mind that 
TSLA
 hasn't missed EPS expectations since 2Q19. (PVIEW)

  (280.63 
+18.86
)
Ongoing price cuts and U.S. tax credits for electric vehicles (EVs) again offset the broader economic headwinds in Q2, including higher interest rates and sticky inflation, fueling 
Tesla's (
TSLA
 +7%)
 record deliveries in the quarter and energizing the stock. Tesla delivered 466,140 vehicles in Q2, nicely ahead of street estimates and a 10.5% improvement from the previous quarter, which was also a record. 
 Tesla's delivery report may also not be the sole factor sending its shares higher today. Several other EV manufacturers, including 
Rivian (RIVN)
, 
XPeng (XPEV)
, 
NIO (NIO)
, and 
Li Auto (LI)
, each registered solid delivery figures in Q2 and June, a broader reflection of underlying health within the EV industry. The upbeat reports are also lifting other non-pure EV OEMs, such as 
Ford (F)
, 
General Motors (GM)
, and 
Volkswagen (VWAGY)
. 
Tesla divides its deliveries into Model S/X (higher-priced models) and Model 3/Y (lower-priced models). Its lower-priced Model 3/Y group exhibited notable strength, with deliveries up a whopping 87.4% yr/yr and 8.4% sequentially to 446,915. The yr/yr growth showcased the pent-up demand following a lengthy chip shortage that hindered production last year. 
 Meanwhile, Model S/X deliveries were the inverse, climbing 19.0% yr/yr and 79.8% sequentially to 19,225. The massive leap from Q1 is due to January price cuts, which were most significant across the Model S and X lineup, not taking effect until March. Additional reductions in April also saw Tesla's higher-tier lineup receive larger discounts than the Model 3 and Y. 
However, even though the slashed prices helped power higher deliveries, it likely came at the further expense of margins. Last quarter, this worry partly contributed to a notable sell-off. Tesla also did see margin erosion during Q1, with total gross margins contracting by 977 bps yr/yr and 450 bps sequentially to 19.3%, well shy of analyst expectations. 
 Furthermore, a disparity between production (479,700) and deliveries (466,140) remained relatively wide in Q2. When production continues to exceed deliveries, it signals rising inventories, a reflection of potential demand weakness. However, the discrepancy continued to narrow over the past three quarters on an absolute and percentage basis. Additionally, management remarked last quarter that the production/delivery difference resulted from the company moving to a more-regional balanced mix of build and deliveries.
  Tesla's recent price cuts to qualify its vehicle lineup for the new U.S. tax credits have sparked a significant rally in deliveries over the past two quarters. Unlike after its Q1 report, investors applaud Tesla's numbers from Q2, a reflection of dissipating worries that China-based competitors are stealing market share and macroeconomic conditions are eroding demand. 
 Although margins will likely undergo another quarter of contraction in Q2 (scheduled for July 19), Tesla's actions have spurred considerable demand. They may also accelerate its long-term goal of reaching 20 mln in annual deliveries. With Tesla's charging technology quickly becoming the U.S. standard following deals with Ford and GM and its long-awaited Cybertruck slated for launch this year, the company is showing no signs of letting off the throttle despite its shares already surging over 140% YTD.

  (252.09 
+17.23
)
The good news keeps pouring in for 
Tesla
 (
TSLA
), which is trading at its highest levels since early October of last year, with the stock receiving yet another boost  courtesy of 
General Motors
 (
GM
). About two weeks after rival 
Ford Motor
 (
F
) reached an agreement with 
TSLA
 that provides its EV customers with access to Tesla Superchargers, GM announced a similar deal with 
TSLA
 last night. Specifically, the partnership will allow GM's EV drivers to use 12,000 Tesla Superchargers across North America starting in 2024 in a move that market participants are viewing as a win-win situation.
For 
TSLA
, the benefit of these agreements with GM and Ford is two-fold.
First, and most importantly, providing GM and Ford access to its Superchargers will likely give it an insurmountable lead in the race to establish an industry standard for charging. Currently, there are two primary charging systems in the market: the North American Charging Standard (NACS) design that 
TSLA
 has adopted, and the Combined Charging System (CCS) used by GM, Ford, and other EV makers.
Initially, GM customers will need to use an adapter to access 
TSLA
's Supercharger stations, but beginning in 2025, the company's EVs will be built with a NACS inlet, removing the need for an adapter. 
With GM and Ford switching over to the NACS connector design, 
TSLA
's charging network will significantly expand while likely ultimately becoming the single standard. A more robust charging network across the country will make 
TSLA
's vehicles even more marketable, reducing customers' concerns about inadequate charging options on the roadways.
Second, 
TSLA
 will generate substantially more revenue from its Supercharger stations. In 3Q23, Services and Other Revenue, which includes paid Supercharging fees, increased by 44% to $1.8 bln. 
Although the Services and Other category only represented about 8% of 
TSLA
's total revenue in Q3, that percentage should increase as GM and Ford EV customers begin accessing its charging stations. 
For some context, GM has said that it will have the capacity to build 1.0 mln EVs in North America by 2025, while Ford is targeting a 2.0 mln EV run rate by 2026.
From GM's perspective, the upside of partnering with 
TSLA
 is that it will instantly and significantly expand the charging network for its customers, without having to invest in the buildout of its own system. CEO Mary Barra commented that collaborating with 
TSLA
 ""knocks down a possible barrier to car buyers, some of whom worry about adequate charging"" on the roads.
The main takeaway is that this agreement with GM is another big win for 
TSLA
, amplifying a bullish sentiment that has defined the stock over the past month. Earlier this week, it was reported that all trims of the company's Model 3 sedan now officially qualify for the full $7,500 tax credit, following a report from 
Electrek
 on May 25 that 
TSLA
's Model Y became the world's best-selling car. Looking further down the road, the upcoming launch of the Cybertruck later this summer could represent the next catalyst for

"20-Apr-23  10:26 ET","TSLA","Tesla's aggressive price cutting strategy puts major dent in margins, sending stock in reverse
  (167.02 
-13.57
)
The million-dollar question heading into 
Tesla's
 (
TSLA
) 1Q23 earnings report was whether the electric vehicle maker's margins would at least meet expectations following a series of price cuts in the U.S. and China.
Last night, investors didn't receive the answer they were looking for as automotive gross margin (excluding regulatory credits) cratered by five percentage points sequentially to about 16%, while 
TSLA
's overall gross margin of 19% fell well short of estimates. 
Some may recall that CFO Zachary Kirkhorn stated that FY23 automotive gross margin should stay above 20% for FY23, but a steep drop in ASPs this quarter pushed the metric below that floor level.
Despite the plunge in gross margin, 
TSLA
 still managed to meet EPS estimates. 
However, 
TSLA
's profitability and cash flow on a yr/yr basis is heading in reverse. Specifically, net income and free cash flow tumbled by 22% and 80%, respectively. Making matters worse for the stock, CEO Elon Musk signaled during the earnings call that more price cuts could be on the horizon, stating that he intends to continue leveraging the company's position as a cost leader.
Essentially, Musk is creating a price war in the EV market -- whether he wants to admit it or not -- in order to protect/gain market share and grow volumes, at the expense of profits. This isn't a positive development for other EV makers, especially for up-and-coming companies like 
Rivian 
(
RIVN
) or 
Lucid Group
 (
LCID
) that are already being squeezed by manufacturing inefficiencies due to low production volumes.
It's also not a positive for 
TSLA
 -- at least, not in the short-term. The stock is not cheap, trading with a Forward P/E of nearly 50x. With the ""E"" component of that valuation metric set to decline, the ""P"" component will have to follow suit in order to avoid a valuation that truly reaches nose-bleed levels.
On the positive side, 
TSLA
 did reaffirm its expectation to deliver about 1.8 mln vehicles in FY23, representing impressive yr/yr growth of 31%. 
In fact, just like last quarter, Musk said that the company may be able to reach the 2 mln mark this year for deliveries. Even as Musk predicts more ""stormy weather"" for the economy this year, he expects that demand will hold up quite well.
Additionally, Mr. Kirkhorn noted that cost reductions and improved efficiency at its new factories should support improved margins later this year. Whether those factors are enough to fully offset the price cuts and drive automotive gross margin back above 20% remains to be seen, but at least the trend for improved production efficiency is accelerating.
The main takeaway is that 
TSLA
's aggressive price cutting strategy is having a worse-than-feared impact on its margins and profits, which is a bad recipe for an expensive stock. From a longer-term perspective, the company's strategy to drive volume higher and extend its lead in the EV market will probably pay dividends, but it's going to be bumpy ride for investors as its profits dwindle.
 "
"20-Apr-23  06:01 ET","TSLA","Tesla comments from conference call

The company reduced prices considerably in early Q1, but its operating margin remains among the best in the industry. The company is under the view that pushing for higher volumes and a larger fleet is the right choice here versus a lower volume and higher margin. The company expects its vehicles, over time, will be able to generate significant profit through autonomy.
Regarding the Cybertruck, the company continues to build Alpha versions of the Cybertruck and the company is anticipating having delivery event in Q3.

  (181.46

)
After the close, leading electric vehicle maker 
Tesla 
(
TSLA
) is scheduled to report 1Q23 earnings with a conference call set to follow at 5:30 p.m. E.T. The company's earnings report is expected to be posted on the Investor Relations page of its website at about 4:05 p.m., followed soon thereafter by a press release.
For the quarter, 
TSLA
 is expected to post EPS and revenue of $0.85 and $23.36 bln, respectively. On a yr/yr basis, an inline quarter would equate to a yr/yr EPS decline of 74%, on a revenue increase of 24.5%.
The main story revolving around 
TSLA
 over the past several months has been its steady stream of price cuts and the anticipated impact on automotive gross margin from those price cuts. Just last night, the company once again lowered its prices, this time reducing the price on each version of its Model Y SUV by $3,000 and cutting the cost on the base Model 3 by nearly 5%.
This round of cuts marks the sixth time that 
TSLA
 has reduced prices over the past year. Recall that in January, the company slashed U.S. prices by as much as 20% on the Model Y and Model 3 vehicles in order to qualify those vehicles for tax credits under the Inflation Reduction Act.
Prior to the U.S. price cuts, 
TSLA
 looked to spark demand in China by lowering prices for all versions of its Model 3 and Model Y cars in October, and then again in January.
From a demand perspective, the pricing strategy has been a clear success. When 
TSLA
 reported Q4 earnings in late January, CEO Elon Musk stated that January had so far seen the strongest orders on a year-to-date basis in the company's history, and that orders are coming in at almost twice the rate of production.
Fast forward to April 3, and 
TSLA
 reported a new quarterly record for deliveries, which increased by 36% yr/yr to 422,875, slightly topping analysts' estimates. Model 3 and Model Y were especially strong with combined deliveries of 412,180, up 40% yr/yr, illustrating the positive impact from the price cuts.
The big question heading into this earnings report, though, is how severe of an impact those price cuts have had on 
TSLA
's automotive gross margin
. Last quarter, automotive gross margin dipped by 466 bps yr/yr to 25.9% -- even as ASPs were up on a yr/yr basis -- as the launch of new plants in Austin, TX and Berlin, Germany weighed on margins. Most of the price cuts didn't take hold until Q1, so the yr/yr decline in automotive gross margin could be pretty jarring tonight.
CFO Zachary Kirkhorn has stated that FY23 automotive gross margin should remain above 20% with average selling prices in the high $40K range.
 Therefore, if automotive gross margin comes in comfortably ahead of that 20% mark, that could be a positive catalyst for the stock.
TSLA
's annual production guidance will be another closely monitored item. In the Q4 earnings report, the company guided for production of 1.8 mln vehicles this year, equating to yr/yr growth of about 37%.
 However, Musk revealed that internal projections are targeting production closer to 2.0 mln vehicles and that he wanted to remain conservative with the published guidance due to uncertainties regarding the supply chain and economy. Should 
TSLA
 produce 2.0 mln vehicles this year, that would equate to yr/yr growth of 46%.
Finally, 
TSLA
's recent history of outperforming analysts' expectations is encouraging. On that note, the company has exceeded EPS and revenue estimates in seven of the past eight quarters,

  (158.04 
+13.61
)
The intensifying demand concerns that sent shares of 
Tesla
 (
TSLA
) spiraling lower in 2022 are fading into the rearview mirror following the EV maker's encouraging 4Q22 earnings report. 
TSLA
 beat analysts' EPS estimates, despite a 446 bps contraction in automotive gross margin, but the main story centers on a surge in orders that were sparked by the company's recent price cuts.
During last night's earnings call, Elon Musk stated that January has so far seen the strongest orders on a year-to-date basis in 
TSLA
's history, and that orders are coming in at almost twice the rate of production.
Simply put, the price cuts have been far more effective than many had imagined, validating 
TSLA
's strategy to sacrifice margins in the near-term for volume and market share. 
A key aspect of the price cuts is that they made most of 
TSLA
's models eligible for the $7,500 tax credit under the Inflation Reduction Act. When combined with the price discount, the tax incentive lowered the overall price by over 20% on some models. That's a meaningful decrease that expands 
TSLA
's potential customer base. 
While Musk's gloomy macroeconomic outlook hasn't changed, with the eccentric CEO predicting a painful recession this year, he still expects 2023 to be a strong year for 
TSLA
. 
Officially, the company guided for production of 1.8 mln vehicles this year, equating to yr/yr growth of about 37%. However, Musk revealed that internal projections are targeting production closer to 2.0 mln vehicles and that he wanted to remain conservative with the published guidance due to uncertainties regarding the supply chain and economy. Should 
TSLA
 produce 2.0 mln vehicles this year, that would equate to yr/yr growth of 46%. 
Of course, Musk's mission to bring Tesla EVs to the masses will come at a cost: namely, lower margins and profits. We saw this play out in Q4 as operating margin slipped by 120 bps sequentially to 16.0%. 
Looking ahead, more margin compression is likely, but the impact is perhaps not as severe as investors had anticipated. CFO Zachary Krikhorn soothed those worries by stating that FY23 automotive gross margin should remain above 20%.
Further down the road, the next major growth catalyst is set to unfold in FY24 when the oft-delayed Cybertruck will finally begin mass production at the Austin, TX plant. By that time, it's also possible that margins could be experiencing some relief from lower commodity prices due to slower economic growth. 
There are still plenty of challenges confronting 
TSLA
, including rising competition in China from up-and-coming manufacturers like 
BYD Co
. (
BYDDY
) and 
NIO
 (
NIO
), but the Q4 earnings beat and bullish commentary suggest that fears about slumping demand were mostly overblown.

TSLA
 shares were running higher heading into this report, rallying by nearly 30% since early January. As it became clearer that demand was softening in Q4 -- as evidenced by 
TSLA
's production stoppage in Shanghai, and its price cuts in the U.S. and China -- EPS estimates came tumbling lower. 
TSLA
 was able to edge past those deflated estimates, but we wonder if that will be enough to keep this upward momentum going.
As anticipated, automotive gross margin took a pretty big hit, sliding lower by 466 bps yr/yr to 25.9%. While 
TSLA
 reported that ASPs were up on a yr/yr basis, they almost certainly were lower on a qtr/qtr basis. 
The company adjusted its guidance, which could be throwing some investors off. The past few quarters, 
TSLA
 has said that it expects to achieve 50% average annual growth in vehicle deliveries over a multi-year horizon. Today, the company said its growing production in alignment with the 50% CAGR target it previously guided to, adding that it some years it may grow faster and some slower. For 2023, 
TSLA
 says it ""expects to remain ahead of the long-term CAGR with around 1.8 mln cars for the year."" If 
TSLA
 delivers 1.8 mln cars in FY23, that would pencil out to yr/yr growth of 37%, which is obviously below that 50% figure.

  (143.13 
-0.71
)
After the close, 
Tesla 
(
TSLA
) is scheduled to report 4Q22 earnings with a conference call set for 5:30 p.m. ET. The electric vehicle maker's earnings report is expected to be posted on the Investor Relations page of its website at about 4:05 p.m., followed soon thereafter by a press release.
Current estimates for 
TSLA
 call for the company to report EPS and revenue of $1.11 and $24.3 bln, respectively. An inline quarter would represent a 56% yr/yr decrease in EPS and a 37% jump in revenue.
TSLA
 crashed in 2022 with shares plunging by ~65%. December was especially rough for 
TSLA
 as demand concerns intensified as the EV maker began slashing prices in China and the U.S. Additionally, the EV maker halted all production at its Shanghai facility on December 24, according to
 Reuters
. As the news became more worrisome, estimates for 
TSLA
's Q4 Production and Delivery report skidded lower, putting more downward pressure on the stock.
It turned out that Q4 delivery estimates were still too high as 
TSLA
's deliveries of 405,000 missed the mark. Similar to Q3, 
TSLA
 produced far more cars than it delivered -- 439,000 vs. 405,000 -- adding to investors' angst. However, 
TSLA
 explained that the variance is not demand related, but rather, is due to its transition towards a more even regional mix of vehicle builds to contend with the increasing difficulty of securing vehicle transportation at a reasonable cost.
Once the calendar flipped to 2023, the stock executed a sharp U-turn and is currently higher by about 16% year-to-date. That rebound could put the stock in a precarious position if 
TSLA
 falls short of estimates that have been reduced in recent weeks. 
With 
TSLA
 ramping up discounts, the obvious risk is that a dip in ASPs will accelerate its automotive gross margin erosion. That concern was amplified when the 
Wall Street Journal
 reported on January 13 that 
TSLA
 cut prices in the U.S. by as much as 20% on some vehicles. Last quarter, automotive gross margin declined by 260 bps yr/yr to 27.9%, partly due to the ramp up of production at 
TSLA
's Austin, TX and Berlin, Germany plants. Those two plants don't benefit from the same economies of scale that 
TSLA
's Shanghai and Fremont, CA plants do, resulting in much lower margins.
Plenty of attention will be given to 
TSLA
's outlook. The company has stuck with its guidance of ""achieving 50% average annual growth in vehicle deliveries over a multi-year horizon"", but it didn't meet that target in 2022 as deliveries grew by 40% to 1.31 mln. For Musk and Company, the hope is that its aggressive price cut strategy will translate into a major upswing in sales and deliveries. There's some early evidence that this strategy is paying dividends with 
Electrek
 reporting on January 17 that 
TSLA
 is experiencing record demand in response to its price cuts.
Despite the macroeconomic uncertainties, 
TSLA
 isn't taking its foot off the accelerator in terms of expanding its capacity. The company recently confirmed that it will invest over $3.6 bln to expand Gigafactory Nevada, which will house production of its Semi truck. Additionally, 
Bloomberg
 reported on January 11 that 
TSLA
 is nearing a deal to construct a facility in Indonesia.
Lastly, 
TSLA
 still has a rich valuation with a forward P/E of about 28x, but that is down substantially from last September when the stock was trading with a forward P/E of 45x. (PVIEW)

  (112.83

Shares of 
Tesla (
TSLA
 -8%)
 are pulling back today following the EV maker's Q4 Delivery and Production report. Growth was substantial, with 
TSLA
's total vehicle production jumping 44% yr/yr to 439,701 while deliveries climbed 31% to 405,278. However, 
TSLA
's record deliveries still missed analyst expectations, its third consecutive miss. It also does not help that analysts trimmed their estimates in the weeks leading to 
TSLA
's report. 
Meanwhile, the gap between production and deliveries grew wider sequentially in Q4, keeping demand concerns in the spotlight. However, the gap remains related to 
TSLA
's transition towards a more even regional mix of vehicle builds to contend with the increasing difficulty of securing vehicle transportation at a reasonable cost. 
 This was set in motion last quarter, resulting in an uptick in cars in transit at the end of Q3. The same held true in Q4; 
TSLA
 commented that its ongoing transition again led to a further increase in vehicles in transit at the end of the quarter. 
 Still, in China, competition is heating up as 
TSLA
's Chinese competitors, 
NIO (NIO)
, 
Li Auto (LI)
, and 
Xpeng (XPEV)
, are all punching it today after posting upbeat delivery data. NIO and LI each grew deliveries by over 50% yr/yr during December, while XPEV's deliveries surged 94% from the prior month in December. 
 The silver lining is that demand remains robust even as China faces a spike in COVID-19 cases. However, with China comprising just under a third of 
TSLA
's total revs in FY21, fiercer competition in the region adds another obstacle to 
TSLA
's growing list of headwinds. 
This list of headwinds, including rising interest rates, pronounced inflation, and an energy crisis in Europe, will likely make for a bumpy ride in FY23. As a result, 
TSLA
's Q4 deliveries miss was not what the company needed to be added to its plate. Although deliveries set another record, the miss adds further speculation that the demand landscape is souring. The news that 
TSLA
 shut down production at its Shanghai plant just over a week ago, the company reportedly doubling its discount on select vehicles, and CEO Elon Musk's engagement with Twitter only adds to this concern. 
 Bottom line, 
TSLA
 is starting off the new year in the wrong gear, keeping its shares stuck in a downward trend. The stock fell roughly 70% in 2022, tumbling by 60% over just the past three months. However, with the new EV tax credits kicking in and Mr. Musk noting he would abide by the results of a recent Twitter poll and step down as CEO, perhaps investors will buy today's news, helping 
TSLA
 to begin turning a corner.

  (210.41 
-11.63
)
For the first time since 2Q19, 
Tesla
 (
TSLA
) fell short of analysts' earnings and revenue expectations in 3Q22, feeding into concerns that demand is wavering under escalating macroeconomic pressures. 
TSLA
's eccentric CEO, Elon Musk, sent mixed messages about the demand environment during the earnings conference call, stating that he expects an ""epic end of the year"" and that the company will sell every car it produces in Q4.
However, Musk acknowledged that ""demand is a little harder than it would otherwise be"" as the Federal Reserve raises interest rates more than it should, in his opinion. He also said that Europe and China are experiencing different types of recessions, with the former getting hit hard by soaring energy prices, and the latter dealing with plunging property prices.
TSLA
's actual results and outlook, though, don't depict a company that's struggling to find customers.
While 
TSLA
 did slightly miss Q3 estimates, revenue grew by a robust 56% yr/yr to $21.45 bln, marking a new quarterly sales record. Meanwhile, operating margin expanded by more than 260 bps yr/yr to 17.2%, despite the rising costs associated with the ramp up of 
TSLA
's Berlin, Germany and Austin, TX plants. The strong top-line growth, coupled with the margin expansion, drove a 75% yr/yr increase in non-GAAP net income to $3.65 bln.
Each of 
TSLA
's factories produced a record number of vehicles in Q3. Since the end of Q2, Berlin has doubled its weekly output to 2,000 from 1,000 vehicles with the Austin factory not far behind. Automotive gross margin still decreased by nearly 260 bps yr/yr to 27.9%, but the metric was flat on a sequential basis. Considering that the prior quarter's ASP benefitted from lower production at Shanghai (due to COVID lockdowns), the flat qtr/qtr performance looks pretty solid.
TSLA
 maintained its outlook of achieving 50% average annual growth in vehicle deliveries over a multi-year horizon, although CFO Zachary Kirkhorn cautioned that deliveries this year may not meet that growth target. According to Kirkhorn, the issue isn't demand related -- rather, it's due to transportation and logistics constraints.
Recall that when 
TSLA
 reported Q3 production and delivery results on October 3, there was a large discrepancy between production (365K) and deliveries (343K). This difference was caused by challenges in loading huge batches of vehicles onto ships and trains during a timeframe of just a few days. For some context, roughly one-third of Q3 deliveries occurred in the final two weeks of September, with many of those vehicles still in transit when 
TSLA
 issued its production and delivery report.
This issue is expected to play out again in Q4, creating another gap between production and deliveries. 
TSLA
 is working to remedy this situation by smoothing out regional builds throughout the quarter, which should reduce its peak needs for outbound logistics.
Overall, it was a solid quarter for 
TSLA
, but the stock's rich valuation with a forward P/E of ~37x leaves little room for error, especially since the company's demand picture is under such intense scrutiny. Musk tried to ease those valuation concerns last night by predicting that 
TSLA
 will someday be worth more than 
Apple
 (
AAPL
) and Saudi Aramco combined. Based on today's stock action, it's clear that investors are taking that declaration with a huge grain of salt.

  (220.04 
-0.15
)
After today's close, 
Tesla
 (
TSLA
) is scheduled to report 3Q22 results with a conference call following at 5:30 p.m. E.T. The electric vehicle (EV) maker's earnings report is expected to be posted on the Investor Relations page of its website at about 4:05 p.m., followed soon thereafter by a press release.
For the quarter,
 analysts are forecasting 
TSLA
 to report EPS and revenue of $1.08 and $21.9 bln, respectively. After announcing that it delivered a quarterly record of 343,000 vehicles in Q3 (+42% yr/yr) on October 3, 
TSLA
 is poised to report record quarterly revenue as well.
However, 
that delivery number still missed analysts' expectations and trailed the production number of 365,000 by a fairly wide margin. This discrepancy between production and deliveries has created some demand concerns, especially since lead times for new vehicles has been shortening
. 
TSLA
 explained that it's becoming more difficult to secure vehicle transportation at reasonable costs as its production volume grows. As a result, there were more cars in transit at the end of Q3, presumably causing the difference between production and deliveries.
Even prior to the Q3 Production and Delivery report, concerns were growing that rising interest rates and macroeconomic uncertainty would put a dent in demand. 
Despite these headwinds and the persistent supply constraints, 
TSLA
 hasn't backed off its delivery guidance yet. Last quarter, it reiterated that it expects to achieve 50% average annual growth in vehicle deliveries over a multi-year horizon. During the Q2 earnings conference call, Elon Musk commented that the company has the potential for a record-breaking second half of the year.
The company will indeed need an incredible finish to the year to meet its 50% delivery growth target. Specifically, 
TSLA
 will need to deliver nearly 500K vehicles in Q4, representing a sequential increase of 42%
. Even if Musk reaffirms the annual delivery growth guidance, there is bound to be some skepticism that 
TSLA
 will ultimately attain that forecast.
The good news is that production capacity continues to ramp higher as 
TSLA
's new Berlin, Germany and Austin, TX plants increase their output. Last quarter, 
TSLA
 disclosed that Berlin was churning out 1,000 vehicles per week, which should be even higher now. As production increases, manufacturing efficiencies improve, pushing 
TSLA
's automotive gross margin higher.
COVID-related lockdowns in China last quarter caused production and revenue to decline materially on a sequential basis. Consequently, automotive gross margin slipped by 46 bps yr/yr to 27.9%.
 Price increases, a sharp acceleration in production, and some easing of supply chain disruptions should translate into a rebound for automotive gross margin in Q3
.
TSLA
 has been weak heading into the report, down nearly 30% since mid-September. Some of the weakness is attributable to the demand/delivery concerns, but the drama surrounding Musk and his acquisition of 
Twitter 
(
TWTR
) has also weighed on the stock. Musk has already sold about $15 bln in 
TSLA
 shares this year to help finance the deal. Although Musk recently stated that he's likely done selling 
TSLA
 stock, it's not out of the question that another round of selling will be needed if he can't secure enough outside capital to complete the TWTR deal.
Lastly, 
TSLA
 has officially rolled out its Semi Truck with deliveries to 
Pepsi
 (
PEP
) slated for December 1. Commentary regarding demand and ordering trends will be of particular interest during the call. Additionally, participants will be listening for any updates on the Cybertruck pickup, which is expected to launch next year after being delayed by a couple years. (PVIEW)

With this approval, all states now have access to all FY22 and FY23 NEVI formula funding, totaling more than $1.5 billion to help build EV chargers covering approximately 75,000 miles of highway across the country. The NEVI formula funding under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which makes $5 billion available over five years, will help build a convenient, reliable, and affordable EV charging network across the country. President Biden's commitment to making electric vehicles and EV charging accessible to all Americans is critical to fighting the climate crisis and is generating an electric vehicle manufacturing boom across the country.

To ensure success in achieving the proposed 100 percent sales mandate, the proposed regulations appropriately restructure the existing ZEV regulations for model years beginning in 2026.
Colorado, Connecticut, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, New Mexico, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia, and Washington, have adopted California's ZEV and LEV regulations, and two additional states, Pennsylvania and Delaware, have adopted California's LEV regulations and are considering adopting California's ZEV regulation, which, when combined with California, account for about 40 percent of both the population or people and new light-duty vehicle sales in the United States.""

"21-Jul-22  10:24 ET","TSLA","Tesla speeding higher with company poised to hit the accelerator on production in 2H22
  (785.03 
+42.53
)
Tesla's
 (
TSLA
) revenue and automotive gross margin declined significantly on a sequential basis in 2Q22, ending a string of increases for both key metrics over the past several quarters. While the electric vehicle maker easily surpassed EPS expectations as operating expenses also fell on a qtr/qtr basis, its free cash flow of $621 mln came up short of analysts' estimates. Despite these blemishes, the initial reaction to 
TSLA
's earnings report has been positive for a few reasons.
Due to the COVID-related lockdowns in China and the associated shutdown of 
TSLA
's Shanghai facility, a rough quarter was anticipated and baked into the stock. Since early April, shares have plunged by 35%, setting up a rebound on results that are better-than-feared. Ahead of the print, there was some concern that 
TSLA
 would post a free cash flow number that was much closer to breakeven.
More importantly, 
TSLA
 maintained its delivery guidance, stating that it still expects to achieve 50% average annual growth in vehicle deliveries over a multi-year horizon. During the earnings conference call, Elon Musk commented that the company has the potential for a record-breaking second half of the year.
To reach that 50% growth target this year, the company will need to produce about 1.4 mln vehicles in 2022.
So far in 2022, 
TSLA
 has produced approximately 564K vehicles. Therefore, the company will need to make an average of 418K vehicles in Q3 and Q4 to achieve its goal. To put this into perspective, 
TSLA
's highest quarterly production number was 305,840 in 4Q21.
It may seem unrealistic for 
TSLA
 to ramp up production that substantially, especially since the company is going through ""supply chain hell"", as Musk put it. However, the new Berlin factory is becoming a major factor, churning out 1,000 vehicles per week. Additionally, the Shanghai plant was upgraded earlier this month and it is now capable of ramping its weekly production higher by roughly 5,000 vehicles to 22,000 vehicles per week.
Musk offered an optimistic view on inflation and the supply chain, stating that costs may come down later this year. He even suggested that 
TSLA
 may reduce car prices after the company lifted prices several times recently to offset inflationary pressures. An easing of raw material costs in 2H22 could coincide with improving manufacturing efficiencies at its new Berlin and Austin factories, enabling automotive gross margin to reverse higher.
It was a difficult quarter, as reflected in the 10% sequential drop in revenue and the 500 bps contraction in automotive gross margin from Q1. In fact, the quarter was so turbulent that Musk decided to sell 75% of the company's Bitcoin holdings to shore up the balance sheet. This quarter, though, is now in the rearview mirror and a more bullish sentiment is brewing as 
TSLA
 is poised to ramp up production in a major way. There are still macroeconomic risks and uncertainties that can stymie 
TSLA
's momentum, though, including the threat of future lockdowns in China if virus cases increase again.

"20-Jul-22  12:41 ET","TSLA","Tesla earnings preview - A bumpy quarter is widely anticipated, so the focus turns to the company's delivery outlook for 2H22
  (746.38 
+9.79
)
After the close, 
Tesla
 (
TSLA
) is scheduled to report Q2 results with a conference call scheduled for 5:30 p.m. ET. The electric vehicle maker's results should be made available on the Investor Relations page of its website at about 4:05 p.m.
For the quarter, analysts are expecting 
TSLA
 to report EPS and revenue of $1.81 and $16.9 bln, respectively. An inline quarter for sales would equate to a decline of about 10% on a sequential basis. This drop-off, though, is widely-anticipated
 and is partly responsible for the stock's 35% plunge since early April. COVID-related lockdowns in China forced 
TSLA
 to shut down its Shanghai factory for a good portion of the quarter.
The impact of those shutdowns was evident when 
TSLA
 reported Q2 deliveries on July 5. Specifically, deliveries slipped by 18% sequentially to 254,695 vehicles, representing the first qtr/qtr decline in deliveries in two years.
The metric that may best illustrate the difficulties for 
TSLA
 in Q2 is free cash flow. Analysts are forecasting free cash flow of about $900 mln, representing a 60% plunge from Q1.
 While lower deliveries will make a significant dent in cash flow generation, the company is also burning plenty of cash on its new factories in Berlin and Austin. Recall that on June 22, Elon Musk quipped that the two new factories were ""money furnaces"" that were losing billions of dollars.
A sequential decline in automotive gross margin also wouldn't be surprising given that the Berlin and Austin factories are now operational. Those plants will be far less efficient than the Shanghai factory until production is much higher. 
Last quarter, automotive gross margin expanded by 636 bps to 32.9% as a combination of manufacturing efficiencies, price increases, and a favorable mix towards the higher-priced Model Y provided a boost. 
On June 16, 
TSLA
 pushed through another round of price increases across its entire vehicle lineup, but that action was likely too late in the quarter to have much of an effect on Q2 results.
Beyond the rough fundamental picture in Q2, Elon Musk's back-and-forth drama with 
Twitter 
(
TWTR
) has also weighed on 
TSLA
 shares. With TWTR filing a lawsuit against Musk to force him to make good on his $54.20/share bid to buy the company, concerns remain that Musk may need to unload more 
TSLA
 shares to finance the acquisition. 
Since we believe that a rough quarter is already fully anticipated and priced in to the stock, we expect that TWTR's annual delivery growth guidance will be the key that drives the stock action
. 
Last quarter, CFO Zach Kirkhorn reiterated the company's expectation to achieve 50% average annual growth in vehicle deliveries over a multi-year horizon.
At that time, Musk accurately forecasted that Q2 production would be lower than Q1, but he added that Q3 and Q4 should be substantially higher. That prediction may also come to fruition as June 2022 was the highest vehicle production month in 
TSLA
's history.
That momentum temporarily ceased during the first two weeks of July as

  (662.87)
""Some initial observations from the data show that since reporting requirements began, one crash reported for an ADS-equipped vehicle resulted in serious injuries, and 108 of the crashes resulted in no injuries. Of the 130 reported crashes for ADS-equipped vehicles, 108 involved collisions with another vehicle, and 11 involved a vulnerable road user, such as a pedestrian or cyclist.
For vehicles with SAE L2 ADAS, the data show that alleged serious injuries or a fatality occurred in 11 of the 98 crashes where information on injuries was reported. Of the reported crashes for SAE L2 ADAS, at least 116 of the collisions were with another vehicle, and at least four involved a vulnerable road user.
The SGO, issued in June 2021, requires for the first time that manufacturers and operators of vehicles equipped with SAE L2 ADAS or SAE Levels 3-5 ADS report to NHTSA certain crashes when the systems are engaged. The SGO is a first step toward helping the Department take a more data-driven approach to ensuring that AV technology is deployed safely and will help inform future actions, including those to educate consumers and build confidence in advanced vehicle technologies.""

  (725.60)
""The Department of Transportation, in partnership with the Department of Energy, is proposing new standards to make charging electric vehicles (EVs) a convenient, reliable, and affordable for all Americans, including when driving long distances. Without strong standards, chargers would be less reliable, may not work for all cars, or lack common payment methods. The new standards will ensure everyone can use the network --no matter what car you drive or which state you charge in.
The $7.5 billion for EV charging infrastructure in President Biden's Bipartisan Infrastructure Law will build a convenient and equitable charging network through two programs. The National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) program will provide $5 billion in formula funding to States to build out charging infrastructure along highway corridors -- filling gaps in rural, disadvantaged, and hard-to-reach locations while instilling public confidence in charging. Today's minimum standards and requirements will guide States on how to spend federal funds in a way that makes chargers function the same from state-to-state, easy to find, use, and pay for, no matter who operates chargers.""
